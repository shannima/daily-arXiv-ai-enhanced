This paper introduces\nL2M-AID, a novel framework for Autonomous Industrial Defense using\nLLM-empowered, Multi-agent reinforcement learning. L2M-AID orchestrates a team\nof collaborative agents, each driven by a Large Language Model (LLM), to\nachieve adaptive and resilient security. The core innovation lies in the deep\nfusion of two AI paradigms: we leverage an LLM as a semantic bridge to\ntranslate vast, unstructured telemetry into a rich, contextual state\nrepresentation, enabling agents to reason about adversary intent rather than\nmerely matching patterns. This semantically-aware state empowers a Multi-Agent\nReinforcement Learning (MARL) algorithm, MAPPO, to learn complex cooperative\nstrategies. The MARL reward function is uniquely engineered to balance security\nobjectives (threat neutralization) with operational imperatives, explicitly\npenalizing actions that disrupt physical process stability. To validate our\napproach, we conduct extensive experiments on the benchmark SWaT dataset and a\nnovel synthetic dataset generated based on the MITRE ATT&CK for ICS framework.\nResults demonstrate that L2M-AID significantly outperforms traditional IDS,\ndeep learning anomaly detectors, and single-agent RL baselines across key\nmetrics, achieving a 97.2% detection rate while reducing false positives by\nover 80% and improving response times by a factor of four. Crucially, it\ndemonstrates superior performance in maintaining physical process stability,\npresenting a robust new paradigm for securing critical national infrastructure."}

In this work, we propose a hybrid model where we\nactivate reasoning mechanisms in base models at the right time to elicit\nthinking-model-level reasoning chains, implying that thinking models exploit\nalready existing capabilities. To ground our analysis, we introduce an\nunsupervised, bottom-up approach for uncovering human-interpretable reasoning\nbehaviors in thinking models. This approach provides an unbiased method to\ndiscover reasoning behaviors without imposing manual or LLM-derived\nassumptions. Across three base and four thinking models, using GSM8K and\nMATH500, our hybrid model recovers up to 91% of the performance gap to thinking\nmodels without any weight updates while steering only 12% of tokens.\nConcretely, our empirical setup provides a simple, causal way to test the\neffectiveness of existing reasoning mechanisms in base models by invoking them\ndirectly and measuring the resulting task performance.

To this end, we first develop Safe Off-Policy Policy\nGradient (Safe OPG), which is a model-free safe OPL method based on a high\nconfidence off-policy evaluation. In our first experiment, we observe that Safe\nOPG almost always satisfies a safety requirement, even when existing methods\nviolate it greatly. However, the result also reveals that Safe OPG tends to be\ntoo conservative, suggesting a difficult tradeoff between guaranteeing safety\nand exploring novel actions. To overcome this tradeoff, we also propose a novel\nframework called Deployment-Efficient Policy Learning for Safe User\nExploration, which leverages safety margin and gradually relaxes safety\nregularization during multiple (not many) deployments. Our framework thus\nenables exploration of novel actions while guaranteeing safe implementation of\nrecommender systems."}

This limitation has driven the development of Test-Time\nGraph Domain Adaptation (TT-GDA), which aims to transfer knowledge without\naccessing the source examples. Inspired by the generative power of large\nlanguage models (LLMs), we introduce a novel framework that reframes TT-GDA as\na generative graph restoration problem, \"restoring the target graph to its\npristine, source-domain-like state\". There are two key challenges: (1) We need\nto construct a reasonable graph restoration process and design an effective\nencoding scheme that an LLM can understand, bridging the modality gap.

However, the contribution of\nreflections to performance improvement remains unclear. In this paper, we\nsystematically analyze the rollouts of eight reasoning models on five\nmathematical datasets. We focus on reflective behaviours where the model has\nalready produced an answer but continues reflecting before finalizing its\noutput. Our analysis reveals that reflections are predominantly confirmatory\nand rarely alter the model's initial answer, a pattern consistent across models\nand datasets. To understand the role of reflections in training, we construct\nsupervised fine-tuning (SFT) datasets with varying amounts of reflection steps.\nWe observe that training models on rollouts with more reflection steps\nprimarily enhances first-answer correctness rather than the ability to correct\ninitially wrong answers through reflections. This motivates us to propose a\nquestion-aware early-stopping method that enhances inference-time token\nefficiency by stopping the reasoning process once a few plausible candidate\nanswers are generated, thereby reducing unnecessary reflection steps. Motivated\nby this, we further propose to dynamically truncate the reflections after a\ncandidate answer has appeared during generation, which reduces reasoning tokens\nby 24.5% across five mathematical datasets, within a 2.9% drop in accuracy."}

Recent results reveal a crossover phenomenon: while RLVR models\noutperform the base model at small k values, the base model usually outperforms\nthem when sampling a very large number of completions. This has been\ninterpreted as evidence that base models have a larger reasoning boundary. We\nargue that on tasks with discrete answer spaces, such as math with numeric\noutputs, Pass@k at large k reflects the increasingly higher chance of success\nin the limit of the number of trials rather than genuine reasoning, and can\ntherefore be misleading.

As a result, they cannot leverage past full trajectories or share\ninformation across branches, limiting self-evolving ability and search space\ndiversity.

Strategic information gathering requires models to know not only how to\neffectively acquire information, but also when to stop gathering information\nand make a decision, in order to avoid overthinking or getting derailed when\nacting. In this paper, we formalize this problem and introduce Counterfactuals\nand Reasoning for Termination (CaRT), an approach for teaching LLMs when to\nstop seeking information. To appropriately learn when to terminate, CaRT\nfine-tunes LLMs using counterfactual pairs of trajectories, one where\ntermination is appropriate and a minimally modified version of the same\ntrajectory where it is not. It trains the LLM to explain the rationale for the\ntermination decision in either case via verbal reasoning, and imbues this\ncapability into the base LLM via fine-tuning. We instantiate CaRT in two\ndomains: interactive medical diagnosis and math problem solving.
