Yet, unlike learning, where generalization and out of\ndistribution (OoD) evaluation concepts are well formalized, there is no clear,\nconsistent definition or metric for reasoning ability. We propose Complexity\nOut of Distribution (Complexity OoD) generalization as a framework and problem\nsetting to define and measure reasoning. A model exhibits Complexity OoD\ngeneralization when it maintains performance on test instances whose minimal\nrequired solution complexity, either representational (richer solution\nstructure) or computational (more reasoning steps/program length), exceeds that\nof all training examples. We formalize complexity via solution description\nKolmogorov complexity and operational proxies (e.g., object/relation counts;\nreasoning step counts), clarifying how Complexity OoD differs from length and\ncompositional OoD. This lens unifies learning and reasoning: many cases\nsolvable with System1 like processing at low complexity become System2 like\nunder complexity pressure, while System2 can be viewed as generalization over\nsolution structures. We translate this perspective into practice with\nrecommendations for operationalizing Complexity OoD across the stack:\nincorporating complexity into benchmark and evaluation metric design,\nrethinking supervision to target solution traces, seeking and designing\ninductive biases for Complexity OoD generalization, addressing learning to\nreason spillovers such as spurious shortcuts, semantic robustness, catastrophic\nforgetting, and step wise calibration. Because Complexity OoD cannot be solved\nby scaling data alone, progress toward robust reasoning will require\narchitectures and training regimes that explicitly model and allocate\ncomputation with respect to complexity."}

In this work, we introduce BuilderBench, a benchmark to\naccelerate research into agent pre-training that centers open-ended\nexploration. BuilderBench requires agents to learn how to build any structure\nusing blocks. BuilderBench is equipped with $(1)$ a hardware accelerated\nsimulator of a robotic agent interacting with various physical blocks, and\n$(2)$ a task-suite with over 42 diverse target structures that are carefully\ncurated to test an understanding of physics, mathematics, and long-horizon\nplanning. During training, agents have to explore and learn general principles\nabout the environment without any external supervision.

Solving\nthese tasks requires a sort of \\emph{embodied reasoning} that is not reflected\nin words but rather in actions, experimenting with different strategies and\npiecing them together.

This transparency also opens a promising\ndirection: multiple reasoners can directly collaborate on each other's thinking\nwithin a shared trajectory, yielding better inference efficiency and\nexploration. A key prerequisite, however, is the ability to assess the\nusefulness and build on another model's partial thinking -- we call this\noff-trajectory reasoning. Our paper investigates a critical question: can\nstandard solo-reasoning training pipelines deliver desired off-trajectory\nbehaviors? We propose twin tests that capture the two extremes of the\noff-trajectory spectrum, namely Recoverability, which tests whether LLMs can\nbacktrack from \"distractions\" induced by misleading reasoning traces, and\nGuidability, which tests their ability to build upon correct reasoning from\nstronger collaborators. Our study evaluates 15 open-weight LLMs (1.5B-32B) and\nreveals a counterintuitive finding -- \"stronger\" LLMs on benchmarks are often\nmore fragile under distraction. Moreover, all models tested fail to effectively\nleverage guiding steps from collaborators on problems beyond their inherent\ncapabilities with solve rates remaining under 9.2%. Finally, we conduct control\nstudies to isolate the effects of three factors in post-training on these\nbehaviors: the choice of distillation teacher, the use of RL, and data\nselection strategy.

In this paper, we propose a\nreasoning-driven LLM-based pipeline to study effective reasoning behavior\npatterns in agentic search. Using this pipeline, we analyze successful agentic\nsearch trajectories and identify four beneficial reasoning behaviors:\nInformation Verification, Authority Evaluation, Adaptive Search, and Error\nRecovery. Based on these findings, we propose a technique called Behavior\nPriming to train more effective agentic search models. It synthesizes agentic\nsearch trajectories that exhibit these four behaviors and integrates them into\nthe agentic search model through supervised fine-tuning (SFT), followed by\nstandard reinforcement learning (RL). Experiments on three benchmarks (GAIA,\nWebWalker, and HLE) demonstrate that behavior priming yields over 35% gains in\nLlama3.2-3B and Qwen3-1.7B compared to directly training agentic search models\nwith RL. Crucially, we demonstrate that the desired reasoning behaviors in the\nSFT data, rather than the correctness of the final answer, is the critical\nfactor for achieving strong final performance after RL: fine-tuning on\ntrajectories with desirable reasoning behaviors but incorrect answers leads to\nbetter performance than fine-tuning on trajectories with correct answers.

We introduce\nTree-Guided Policy Refinement (TGPR), a novel framework that combines GRPO with\na Thompson-Sampling-based tree search. TGPR explores both failed and successful\nrefinement paths actively, with denser training trajectories and more adaptive\npolicies. On HumanEval, MBPP, and APPS benchmarks, our method achieves up to\n+4.2 percentage points absolute improvement in pass@1 (on MBPP) and up to\n+12.51 percentage points absolute improvement in pass@10 (on APPS) compared to\na competitive GRPO baseline.

Thus, rather than trying to capture this diversity\nwith a single LLM agent, we propose a novel framework to construct a set of\nagents that collectively capture the diversity of a given human population.\nEach agent is an LLM whose behavior is steered by conditioning on a small set\nof human demonstrations (task-response pairs) through in-context learning.

Conventional methods adopt planning with actions where a executable\naction list would be provided as reference.

This naturally leads to a question: As\nenvironmental action space scales, what is the optimal action representation\nfor long-horizon agents? In this paper, we systematically study the\neffectiveness of two different action representations. The first one is\nconventional planning with actions (PwA) which is predominantly adopted for its\neffectiveness on existing benchmarks. The other one is planning with schemas\n(PwS) which instantiate an action schema into action lists (e.g., \"move [OBJ]\nto [OBJ]\" -> \"move apple to desk\") to ensure concise action space and reliable\nscalability. This alternative is motivated by its alignment with human\ncognition and its compliance with environment-imposed action format\nrestriction. We propose cognitive bandwidth perspective as a conceptual\nframework to qualitatively understand the differences between these two action\nrepresentations and empirically observe a representation-choice inflection\npoint between ALFWorld (~35 actions) and SciWorld (~500 actions), which serve\nas evidence of the need for scalable representations.

Understanding the role of the\nconditions of life in this disparity can aid in developing more robust,\nadaptive, and caring artificial agents.

Drawing\ninspiration from Friedrich Nietzsche's existentialist concept of will-to-power,\nwe examine how intrinsic drives to maximize control over future states, e.g.,\nempowerment, allow agents to increase the probability that they will be able to\nmeet their future homeostatic needs, thereby enhancing their capacity to\nmaintain physical integrity.

Furthermore, they oversimplify discovery as static function\nfitting, failing to capture the authentic scientific process of uncovering\nembedded laws through the interactive exploration of complex model systems. To\naddress these critical gaps, we introduce NewtonBench, a benchmark comprising\n324 scientific law discovery tasks across 12 physics domains. Our design\nmitigates the evaluation trilemma by using metaphysical shifts - systematic\nalterations of canonical laws - to generate a vast suite of problems that are\nscalable, scientifically relevant, and memorization-resistant. Moreover, we\nelevate the evaluation from static function fitting to interactive model\ndiscovery, requiring agents to experimentally probe simulated complex systems\nto uncover hidden principles. Our extensive experiment reveals a clear but\nfragile capability for discovery in frontier LLMs: this ability degrades\nprecipitously with increasing system complexity and exhibits extreme\nsensitivity to observational noise. Notably, we uncover a paradoxical effect of\ntool assistance: providing a code interpreter can hinder more capable models by\ninducing a premature shift from exploration to exploitation, causing them to\nsatisfice on suboptimal solutions.
