This\npaper introduces the Structured Cognitive Loop (SCL) as an executable\nepistemological framework for emergent intelligence. Unlike traditional AI\nresearch asking \"what is intelligence?\" (ontological), SCL asks \"under what\nconditions does cognition emerge?\" (epistemological). Grounded in philosophy of\nmind and cognitive phenomenology, SCL bridges conceptual philosophy and\nimplementable cognition. Drawing on process philosophy, enactive cognition, and\nextended mind theory, we define intelligence not as a property but as a\nperformed process -- a continuous loop of judgment, memory, control, action,\nand regulation. SCL makes three contributions. First, it operationalizes\nphilosophical insights into computationally interpretable structures, enabling\n\"executable epistemology\" -- philosophy as structural experiment. Second, it\nshows that functional separation within cognitive architecture yields more\ncoherent and interpretable behavior than monolithic prompt based systems,\nsupported by agent evaluations. Third, it redefines intelligence: not\nrepresentational accuracy but the capacity to reconstruct its own epistemic\nstate through intentional understanding. This framework impacts philosophy of\nmind, epistemology, and AI. For philosophy, it allows theories of cognition to\nbe enacted and tested. For AI, it grounds behavior in epistemic structure\nrather than statistical regularity. For epistemology, it frames knowledge not\nas truth possession but as continuous reconstruction within a\nphenomenologically coherent loop. We situate SCL within debates on cognitive\nphenomenology, emergence, normativity, and intentionality, arguing that real\nprogress requires not larger models but architectures that realize cognitive\nprinciples structurally."}

We observe that access to an environment interface does not delay or\neradicate performance collapse. Furthermore, LLM-parameterized policy analysis\nreveals increasing divergence from both optimal policies and uniformly random\npolicies, suggesting that the model exhibits mode-like collapse at each level\nof complexity, and that performance is dependent upon whether the mode reflects\nthe correct solution for the problem.

We introduce Parallel-in-time Neural Twins\n(PAINT), an architecture-agnostic family of methods for modeling dynamical\nsystems from measurements. PAINT trains a generative neural network to model\nthe distribution of states parallel over time. At test time, states are\npredicted from measurements in a sliding window fashion.

Such interactions between users and an\nalgorithm often unfold over multiple steps, during which strategic users can\nguide the algorithm to better align with their true interests by selectively\nengaging with content. However, users frequently exhibit inconsistent\npreferences: they may spend considerable time on content that offers little\nlong-term value, inadvertently signaling that such content is desirable.\nFocusing on the user side, this raises a key question: what does it take for\nsuch users to align the algorithm with their true interests?\n  To investigate these dynamics, we model the user's decision process as split\nbetween a rational system 2 that decides whether to engage and an impulsive\nsystem 1 that determines how long engagement lasts. We then study a\nmulti-leader, single-follower extensive Stackelberg game, where users,\nspecifically system 2, lead by committing to engagement strategies and the\nalgorithm best-responds based on observed interactions.

This critical horizon can be\nlong, imposing a substantial burden. However, even a small, costly signal\n(e.g., an extra click) can significantly reduce it.

We\nfirst position Reinforcement Learning (RL) as the algorithmic engine enabling\nthis paradigm shift. By reframing learning from imitating static data to\noutcome-driven exploration, RL underpins a unified solution of LLM + RL + Task\nacross language, vision and embodied domains. Building on this, the survey\nsystematically reviews how each capability -- Planning, Tool use, and Memory --\nhas evolved from externally scripted modules to end-to-end learned behaviors.\nFurthermore, it examines how this paradigm shift has reshaped major agent\napplications, specifically the Deep Research agent emphasizing long-horizon\nreasoning and the GUI agent emphasizing embodied interaction. We conclude by\ndiscussing the continued internalization of agentic capabilities like\nMulti-agent collaboration and Reflection, alongside the evolving roles of the\nsystem and model layers in future agentic AI.

While traditional risk scores have\nlimited performance, end-to-end deep learning models often lack the\ninterpretability needed for clinical trust. This study aimed to develop a\nhybrid predictive framework that integrates a large-scale electrocardiogram\n(ECG) foundation model (ECGFounder) with an interpretable XGBoost classifier to\nimprove both accuracy and interpretability. We analyzed 6,634 ECG recordings\nfrom AMI patients, among whom 175 experienced in-hospital VT/VF. The ECGFounder\nmodel was used to extract 150-dimensional diagnostic probability features ,\nwhich were then refined through feature selection to train the XGBoost\nclassifier. Model performance was evaluated using AUC and F1-score , and the\nSHAP method was used for interpretability. The ECGFounder + XGBoost hybrid\nmodel achieved an AUC of 0.801 , outperforming KNN (AUC 0.677), RNN (AUC\n0.676), and an end-to-end 1D-CNN (AUC 0.720). SHAP analysis revealed that\nmodel-identified key features, such as \"premature ventricular complexes\" (risk\npredictor) and \"normal sinus rhythm\" (protective factor), were highly\nconsistent with clinical knowledge.
