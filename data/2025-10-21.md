### [1] [VisuoAlign: Safety Alignment of LVLMs with Multimodal Tree Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15948)
*MingSheng Li,Guangze Zhao,Sichen Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: VisuoAlign是一个通过提示引导树搜索实现多模态安全对齐的框架，旨在解决大视觉语言模型的安全对齐挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有防御方法容易受到多模态越狱攻击，因为视觉输入引入了新的攻击面，推理链缺乏安全监督，且模态融合往往会降低对齐效果。

Method: VisuoAlign通过视觉-文本交互提示将安全约束嵌入推理过程，使用蒙特卡洛树搜索系统构建多样化的安全关键提示轨迹，并引入基于提示的缩放来确保实时风险检测和合规响应。

Result: 大量实验表明，VisuoAlign能够主动暴露风险，实现全面的数据集生成，并显著提高LVLMs对复杂跨模态威胁的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: VisuoAlign框架有效解决了多模态安全对齐的关键挑战，提升了大型视觉语言模型在面对复杂跨模态攻击时的安全性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in
multimodal perception and generation, yet their safety alignment remains a
critical challenge.Existing defenses and vulnerable to multimodal jailbreaks,
as visual inputs introduce new attack surfaces, reasoning chains lack safety
supervision, and alignment often degrades under modality fusion.To overcome
these limitation, we propose VisuoAlign, a framework for multi-modal safety
alignment via prompt-guided tree search.VisuoAlign embeds safety constrains
into the reasoning process through visual-textual interactive prompts, employs
Monte Carlo Tree Search(MCTS) to systematically construct diverse
safety-critical prompt trajectories, and introduces prompt-based scaling to
ensure real-time risk detection and compliant responses.Extensive experiments
demonstrate that VisuoAlign proactively exposes risks, enables comprehensive
dataset generation, and significantly improves the robustness of LVLMs against
complex cross-modal threats.

### [2] [Executable Epistemology: The Structured Cognitive Loop as an Architecture of Intentional Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15952)
*Myung Ho Kim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了结构化认知循环（SCL）作为可执行的认知框架，将哲学洞见转化为可计算结构，重新定义智能为通过意向性理解重建自身认知状态的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型缺乏真正的认知理解，暴露了认知架构的缺失。传统AI关注"什么是智能"的本体论问题，而SCL关注"在什么条件下认知涌现"的认知论问题。

Method: 基于心智哲学和认知现象学，结合过程哲学、具身认知和扩展心智理论，将智能定义为执行过程——判断、记忆、控制、行动和调节的连续循环。

Result: SCL展示了功能分离的认知架构比单一提示系统产生更一致和可解释的行为，支持了智能作为认知状态重建能力的重新定义。

Conclusion: SCL框架对心智哲学、认知论和AI产生重要影响，强调真正的进步需要实现认知原则的结构化架构，而非更大的模型。

Abstract: Large language models exhibit intelligence without genuine epistemic
understanding, exposing a key gap: the absence of epistemic architecture. This
paper introduces the Structured Cognitive Loop (SCL) as an executable
epistemological framework for emergent intelligence. Unlike traditional AI
research asking "what is intelligence?" (ontological), SCL asks "under what
conditions does cognition emerge?" (epistemological). Grounded in philosophy of
mind and cognitive phenomenology, SCL bridges conceptual philosophy and
implementable cognition. Drawing on process philosophy, enactive cognition, and
extended mind theory, we define intelligence not as a property but as a
performed process -- a continuous loop of judgment, memory, control, action,
and regulation. SCL makes three contributions. First, it operationalizes
philosophical insights into computationally interpretable structures, enabling
"executable epistemology" -- philosophy as structural experiment. Second, it
shows that functional separation within cognitive architecture yields more
coherent and interpretable behavior than monolithic prompt based systems,
supported by agent evaluations. Third, it redefines intelligence: not
representational accuracy but the capacity to reconstruct its own epistemic
state through intentional understanding. This framework impacts philosophy of
mind, epistemology, and AI. For philosophy, it allows theories of cognition to
be enacted and tested. For AI, it grounds behavior in epistemic structure
rather than statistical regularity. For epistemology, it frames knowledge not
as truth possession but as continuous reconstruction within a
phenomenologically coherent loop. We situate SCL within debates on cognitive
phenomenology, emergence, normativity, and intentionality, arguing that real
progress requires not larger models but architectures that realize cognitive
principles structurally.

### [3] [Exploring the Potential of Citiverses for Regulatory Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15959)
*Isabelle Hupont,Marisa Ponti,Sven Schade*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出将citiverses（城市虚拟世界）作为监管学习实验空间的政策科学议程，通过专家咨询识别关键研究领域和实验主题，强调负责任的发展方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索citiverses作为沉浸式虚拟环境在监管学习中的潜力，为政策制定提供实验空间，支持复杂政策场景和技术的测试。

Method: 基于与欧盟委员会政策制定者、国家政府科学顾问以及数字监管和虚拟世界领域领先研究者的高层专家小组的咨询。

Result: 识别了包括可扩展性、实时反馈、复杂性建模、跨境协作、风险降低、公民参与、伦理考量和新兴技术集成在内的关键研究领域，并分析了交通、城市规划、环境/气候危机等实验主题。

Conclusion: citiverses有潜力成为监管学习的重要实验空间，但需要负责任的发展方法，充分考虑伦理、经济、生态和社会维度，并整合到更广泛的实验生态系统（如测试平台、生活实验室和监管沙盒）中。

Abstract: Citiverses hold the potential to support regulatory learning by offering
immersive, virtual environments for experimenting with policy scenarios and
technologies. This paper proposes a science-for-policy agenda to explore the
potential of citiverses as experimentation spaces for regulatory learning,
grounded in a consultation with a high-level panel of experts, including
policymakers from the European Commission, national government science advisers
and leading researchers in digital regulation and virtual worlds. It identifies
key research areas, including scalability, real-time feedback, complexity
modelling, cross-border collaboration, risk reduction, citizen participation,
ethical considerations and the integration of emerging technologies. In
addition, the paper analyses a set of experimental topics, spanning
transportation, urban planning and the environment/climate crisis, that could
be tested in citiverse platforms to advance regulatory learning in these areas.
The proposed work is designed to inform future research for policy and
emphasizes a responsible approach to developing and using citiverses. It
prioritizes careful consideration of the ethical, economic, ecological and
social dimensions of different regulations. The paper also explores essential
preliminary steps necessary for integrating citiverses into the broader
ecosystems of experimentation spaces, including test beds, living labs and
regulatory sandboxes

### [4] [PISA: A Pragmatic Psych-Inspired Unified Memory System for Enhanced AI Agency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15966)
*Shian Jia,Ziyang Huang,Xinbo Wang,Haofei Zhang,Mingli Song*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了PISA记忆系统，基于皮亚杰认知发展理论，通过三模态适应机制和混合记忆访问架构，显著提升了AI代理的适应性和长期知识保留能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI代理记忆系统缺乏对多样化任务的适应性，忽视了记忆的建设性和任务导向作用，需要更灵活、自适应的记忆架构。

Method: 基于皮亚杰理论构建PISA系统，采用三模态适应机制（图式更新、图式演进、图式创建）和混合记忆访问架构（符号推理与神经检索结合）。

Result: 在LOCOMO基准和新提出的AggQA数据分析基准上，PISA实现了最先进的性能，显著提升了适应性和长期知识保留。

Conclusion: PISA通过心理启发的方法为AI代理记忆系统提供了建设性、自适应的解决方案，为构建更智能的AI系统奠定了基础。

Abstract: Memory systems are fundamental to AI agents, yet existing work often lacks
adaptability to diverse tasks and overlooks the constructive and task-oriented
role of AI agent memory. Drawing from Piaget's theory of cognitive development,
we propose PISA, a pragmatic, psych-inspired unified memory system that
addresses these limitations by treating memory as a constructive and adaptive
process. To enable continuous learning and adaptability, PISA introduces a
trimodal adaptation mechanism (i.e., schema updation, schema evolution, and
schema creation) that preserves coherent organization while supporting flexible
memory updates. Building on these schema-grounded structures, we further design
a hybrid memory access architecture that seamlessly integrates symbolic
reasoning with neural retrieval, significantly improving retrieval accuracy and
efficiency. Our empirical evaluation, conducted on the existing LOCOMO
benchmark and our newly proposed AggQA benchmark for data analysis tasks,
confirms that PISA sets a new state-of-the-art by significantly enhancing
adaptability and long-term knowledge retention.

### [5] [Limits of Emergent Reasoning of Large Language Models in Agentic Frameworks for Deterministic Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15974)
*Chris Su,Harrison Li,Matheus Marques,George Flint,Kevin Zhu,Sunishchal Dev*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 为大型语言模型提供环境接口（允许其进行移动、观察状态空间并重新提示）并不能延迟或消除在汉诺塔问题中的性能崩溃现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 最近的研究发现大型推理模型在解决超过特定困惑度阈值的谜题时会出现性能崩溃。本文旨在探讨这种崩溃是否源于模型需要自行跟踪状态空间的要求。

Method: 为LLM提供汉诺塔问题的环境接口，允许其通过工具调用进行移动、提供书面理由、观察结果状态空间，并为下一步移动重新提示自身。

Result: 环境接口的访问并不能延迟或消除性能崩溃。LLM参数化策略分析显示与最优策略和均匀随机策略的差异逐渐增大，表明模型在每个复杂度级别都表现出模式崩溃。

Conclusion: 性能取决于模式是否反映问题的正确解决方案，类似现象可能在大型推理模型中也存在。

Abstract: Recent work reports that Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) undergo a collapse in
performance on solving puzzles beyond certain perplexity thresholds. In
subsequent discourse, questions have arisen as to whether the nature of the
task muddles an evaluation of true reasoning. One potential confound is the
requirement that the model keep track of the state space on its own. We provide
a large language model (LLM) with an environment interface for Tower of Hanoi
problems, allowing it to make a move with a tool call, provide written
justification, observe the resulting state space, and reprompt itself for the
next move. We observe that access to an environment interface does not delay or
eradicate performance collapse. Furthermore, LLM-parameterized policy analysis
reveals increasing divergence from both optimal policies and uniformly random
policies, suggesting that the model exhibits mode-like collapse at each level
of complexity, and that performance is dependent upon whether the mode reflects
the correct solution for the problem. We suggest that a similar phenomena might
take place in LRMs.

### [6] [Cognitive Load Traces as Symbolic and Visual Accounts of Deep Model Cognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15980)
*Dong Liu,Yanxuan Yu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出Cognitive Load Traces (CLTs)作为深度模型的中层可解释性框架，通过量化模型内部资源分配来预测错误发生、揭示认知策略，并通过负载引导干预提高推理效率15-30%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受人类认知中的认知负荷理论启发，旨在为深度模型提供可解释的分析框架，理解模型在推理过程中的内部资源分配动态。

Method: 将CLTs定义为三组分随机过程(IL_t, EL_t, GL_t)，分别对应内在、外在和关联负荷，通过注意力熵、KV缓存未命中率、表示分散度和解码稳定性等可测量代理进行实例化。

Result: 在推理和规划基准测试中，CLTs能够预测错误发生、揭示认知策略，并通过负载引导干预在保持准确性的同时提高推理效率15-30%。

Conclusion: CLTs提供了一个有效的可解释性框架，能够深入分析深度模型的推理动态，并为提高模型效率提供实用指导。

Abstract: We propose \textbf{Cognitive Load Traces} (CLTs) as a mid-level
interpretability framework for deep models, inspired by Cognitive Load Theory
in human cognition. CLTs are defined as symbolic, temporally varying functions
that quantify model-internal resource allocation. Formally, we represent CLTs
as a three-component stochastic process $(\mathrm{IL}_t, \mathrm{EL}_t,
\mathrm{GL}_t)$, corresponding to \emph{Intrinsic}, \emph{Extraneous}, and
\emph{Germane} load. Each component is instantiated through measurable proxies
such as attention entropy, KV-cache miss ratio, representation dispersion, and
decoding stability. We propose both symbolic formulations and visualization
methods (load curves, simplex diagrams) that enable interpretable analysis of
reasoning dynamics. Experiments on reasoning and planning benchmarks show that
CLTs predict error-onset, reveal cognitive strategies, and enable load-guided
interventions that improve reasoning efficiency by 15-30\% while maintaining
accuracy.

### [7] [ProofFlow: A Dependency Graph Approach to Faithful Proof Autoformalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15981)
*Rafael Cabral,Tuan Manh Do,Xuejun Yu,Wai Ming Tai,Zijin Feng,Xin Shen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ProofFlow是一个新的证明自动形式化流水线，通过构建逻辑依赖图和使用基于引理的方法来保持原始证明的结构保真度，在184个本科级问题的新基准上取得了0.545的ProofScore，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前证明自动形式化方法主要关注生成可执行代码，但经常无法保持原始人工编写论证的语义含义和逻辑结构，因此需要一种能够保持结构保真度的新方法。

Method: ProofFlow首先构建有向无环图(DAG)来映射证明步骤间的逻辑依赖关系，然后采用基于引理的方法系统地将每个步骤形式化为中间引理，从而保持原始论证的逻辑结构。

Result: 在184个本科级问题的新基准上，ProofFlow实现了0.545的ProofScore，显著优于全证明形式化(0.123)和步骤证明形式化(0.072)等基线方法。

Conclusion: ProofFlow为证明自动形式化设立了新的最先进水平，其流水线、基准和评分指标已开源，以促进该领域的进一步发展。

Abstract: Proof autoformalization, the task of translating natural language theorems
and proofs into machine-verifiable code, is a critical step for integrating
large language models into rigorous mathematical workflows. Current approaches
focus on producing executable code, but they frequently fail to preserve the
semantic meaning and logical structure of the original human-written argument.
To address this, we introduce ProofFlow, a novel pipeline that treats
structural fidelity as a primary objective. ProofFlow first constructs a
directed acyclic graph (DAG) to map the logical dependencies between proof
steps. Then, it employs a novel lemma-based approach to systematically
formalize each step as an intermediate lemma, preserving the logical structure
of the original argument. To facilitate evaluation, we present a new benchmark
of 184 undergraduate-level problems, manually annotated with step-by-step
solutions and logical dependency graphs, and introduce ProofScore, a new
composite metric to evaluate syntactic correctness, semantic faithfulness, and
structural fidelity. Experimental results show our pipeline sets a new
state-of-the-art for autoformalization, achieving a ProofScore of 0.545,
substantially exceeding baselines like full-proof formalization (0.123), which
processes the entire proof at once, and step-proof formalization (0.072), which
handles each step independently. Our pipeline, benchmark, and score metric are
open-sourced to encourage further progress at
https://github.com/Huawei-AI4Math/ProofFlow.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了将MO|RE运动科学研究数据仓库转换为知识图谱的愿景，通过基于基本形式本体的本体论，标准化和机器可理解地表示运动表现数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 运动表现测试是评估和比较不同人群身体和认知能力的关键，但现有数据缺乏标准化和互操作性。MO|RE数据仓库需要更有效的建模和共享机制。

Method: 开发基于基本形式本体(BFO)的本体论，正式表示计划规范、具体过程和相关测量之间的相互关系，将MO|RE数据转换为知识图谱。

Result: 提出了一个系统化的知识图谱构建方法，能够标准化运动表现数据的建模和跨研究共享。

Conclusion: 该方法将改变运动表现数据的建模和共享方式，使其标准化且机器可理解，支持更有效的研究数据整合和分析。

Abstract: An essential component for evaluating and comparing physical and cognitive
capabilities between populations is the testing of various factors related to
human performance. As a core part of sports science research, testing motor
performance enables the analysis of the physical health of different
demographic groups and makes them comparable.
  The Motor Research (MO|RE) data repository, developed at the Karlsruhe
Institute of Technology, is an infrastructure for publishing and archiving
research data in sports science, particularly in the field of motor performance
research. In this paper, we present our vision for creating a knowledge graph
from MO|RE data. With an ontology rooted in the Basic Formal Ontology, our
approach centers on formally representing the interrelation of plan
specifications, specific processes, and related measurements. Our goal is to
transform how motor performance data are modeled and shared across studies,
making it standardized and machine-understandable. The idea presented here is
developed within the Leibniz Science Campus ``Digital Transformation of
Research'' (DiTraRe).

### [9] [A Non-overlap-based Conflict Measure for Random Permutation Sets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16001)
*Ruolan Cheng,Yong Deng,Enrique Herrera-Viedma*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于随机置换集(RPS)的冲突度量方法，从随机有限集(RFS)和Dempster-Shafer理论(DST)两个角度分析RPS中的冲突，利用秩偏重叠(RBO)思想定义置换间的不一致性度量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随机置换集是处理包含顺序信息的不确定性的新形式化方法，如何度量由置换质量函数表示的两个证据之间的冲突是有序结构不确定信息融合中的紧迫研究课题。

Method: 从置换观察出发，基于秩偏重叠(RBO)度量定义置换间的不一致性度量，进一步提出基于非重叠的RPS冲突度量方法，将RPS理论视为DST的扩展。

Result: 通过数值示例展示了所提冲突度量的行为和特性，该方法具有自然的顶部加权特性，能从DST视角有效度量RPS间的冲突。

Conclusion: 所提方法不仅具有自然顶部加权特性，能有效从DST视角度量RPS间的冲突，还为决策者提供了权重、参数和截断深度的灵活选择。

Abstract: Random permutation set (RPS) is a new formalism for reasoning with
uncertainty involving order information. Measuring the conflict between two
pieces of evidence represented by permutation mass functions remains an urgent
research topic in order-structured uncertain information fusion. In this paper,
a detailed analysis of conflicts in RPS is carried out from two different
perspectives: random finite set (RFS) and Dempster-Shafer theory (DST).
Starting from the observation of permutations, we first define an inconsistency
measure between permutations inspired by the rank-biased overlap(RBO) measure
and further propose a non-overlap-based conflict measure method for RPSs. This
paper regards RPS theory (RPST) as an extension of DST. The order information
newly added in focal sets indicates qualitative propensity, characterized by
top-ranked elements occupying a more critical position. Some numerical examples
are used to demonstrate the behavior and properties of the proposed conflict
measure. The proposed method not only has the natural top-weightedness property
and can effectively measure the conflict between RPSs from the DST view but
also provides decision-makers with a flexible selection of weights, parameters,
and truncated depths.

### [10] [PAINT: Parallel-in-time Neural Twins for Dynamical System Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16004)
*Andreas Radler,Vincent Seyfried,Stefan Pirker,Johannes Brandstetter,Thomas Lichtenegger*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PAINT是一种用于建模动态系统的并行时间神经网络孪生方法，能够从稀疏测量中高保真地预测系统状态并保持轨迹跟踪能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经孪生作为神经代理的进一步发展，旨在创建真实系统的数字副本，需要能够在测试时通过测量更新状态以支持情境特定决策，关键特性是保持轨迹跟踪能力。

Method: PAINT训练生成神经网络来并行建模时间上的状态分布，在测试时通过滑动窗口方式从测量中预测状态，是架构无关的方法族。

Result: 理论分析表明PAINT能够保持轨迹跟踪，而自回归模型通常不能。在二维湍流流体动力学问题上的实证评估显示PAINT能够保持轨迹跟踪并从稀疏测量中高保真预测系统状态。

Conclusion: PAINT具有开发能够保持轨迹跟踪的神经孪生的潜力，能够实现更准确的状态估计和决策制定。

Abstract: Neural surrogates have shown great potential in simulating dynamical systems,
while offering real-time capabilities. We envision Neural Twins as a
progression of neural surrogates, aiming to create digital replicas of real
systems. A neural twin consumes measurements at test time to update its state,
thereby enabling context-specific decision-making. A critical property of
neural twins is their ability to remain on-trajectory, i.e., to stay close to
the true system state over time. We introduce Parallel-in-time Neural Twins
(PAINT), an architecture-agnostic family of methods for modeling dynamical
systems from measurements. PAINT trains a generative neural network to model
the distribution of states parallel over time. At test time, states are
predicted from measurements in a sliding window fashion. Our theoretical
analysis shows that PAINT is on-trajectory, whereas autoregressive models
generally are not. Empirically, we evaluate our method on a challenging
two-dimensional turbulent fluid dynamics problem. The results demonstrate that
PAINT stays on-trajectory and predicts system states from sparse measurements
with high fidelity. These findings underscore PAINT's potential for developing
neural twins that stay on-trajectory, enabling more accurate state estimation
and decision-making.

### [11] [Global-focal Adaptation with Information Separation for Noise-robust Transfer Fault Diagnosis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16033)
*Junyu Ren,Wensheng Gan,Guangyu Zhang,Wei Zhong,Philip S. Yu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出ISGFAN框架解决噪声环境下跨域故障诊断问题，通过信息分离架构和全局-局部对抗学习提升鲁棒性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有故障诊断方法假设数据干净或域相似性足够，但在工业环境中噪声干扰和域偏移同时存在，限制了现有方法的有效性

Method: 基于信息分离架构，结合对抗学习和改进正交损失解耦域不变故障表示；采用全局-局部域对抗方案约束条件分布和边际分布

Result: 在三个公共基准数据集上的实验表明，该方法优于其他现有方法

Conclusion: ISGFAN框架在噪声环境下的跨域故障诊断中表现出优越性

Abstract: Existing transfer fault diagnosis methods typically assume either clean data
or sufficient domain similarity, which limits their effectiveness in industrial
environments where severe noise interference and domain shifts coexist. To
address this challenge, we propose an information separation global-focal
adversarial network (ISGFAN), a robust framework for cross-domain fault
diagnosis under noise conditions. ISGFAN is built on an information separation
architecture that integrates adversarial learning with an improved orthogonal
loss to decouple domain-invariant fault representation, thereby isolating noise
interference and domain-specific characteristics. To further strengthen
transfer robustness, ISGFAN employs a global-focal domain-adversarial scheme
that constrains both the conditional and marginal distributions of the model.
Specifically, the focal domain-adversarial component mitigates
category-specific transfer obstacles caused by noise in unsupervised scenarios,
while the global domain classifier ensures alignment of the overall
distribution. Experiments conducted on three public benchmark datasets
demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other prominent existing
approaches, confirming the superiority of the ISGFAN framework. Data and code
are available at https://github.com/JYREN-Source/ISGFAN

### [12] [Algorithms for dynamic scheduling in manufacturing, towards digital factories Improving Deadline Feasibility and Responsiveness via Temporal Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16047)
*Ioan Hedea*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 结合离线约束规划优化与在线时间网络执行，创建在不确定性下仍可行的调度方案，消除所有截止期限违规，仅增加3-5%制造周期开销


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代制造系统需要满足严格的交付期限，同时应对由过程噪声、设备变异性和人为干预引起的随机任务持续时间。传统确定性调度在现实偏离名义计划时会崩溃，导致昂贵的紧急维修

Method: 首先构建柔性作业车间约束规划模型，插入最优缓冲Δ*获得完全主动基线，然后将计划转换为带不确定性的简单时间网络并验证动态可控性

Result: 在Kacem 1-4基准测试套件上的蒙特卡洛模拟显示，该方法消除了100%的截止期限违规，仅增加3-5%制造周期开销，中等规模实例的求解时间和STNU检查保持亚秒级

Conclusion: 时间网络推理能够弥合主动缓冲与动态鲁棒性之间的差距，推动行业向真正数字化、自校正工厂迈进

Abstract: Modern manufacturing systems must meet hard delivery deadlines while coping
with stochastic task durations caused by process noise, equipment variability,
and human intervention. Traditional deterministic schedules break down when
reality deviates from nominal plans, triggering costly last-minute repairs.
This thesis combines offline constraint-programming (CP) optimisation with
online temporal-network execution to create schedules that remain feasible
under worst-case uncertainty. First, we build a CP model of the flexible
job-shop with per-job deadline tasks and insert an optimal buffer $\Delta^*$ to
obtain a fully pro-active baseline. We then translate the resulting plan into a
Simple Temporal Network with Uncertainty (STNU) and verify dynamic
controllability, which guarantees that a real-time dispatcher can retime
activities for every bounded duration realisation without violating resource or
deadline constraints. Extensive Monte-Carlo simulations on the open Kacem~1--4
benchmark suite show that our hybrid approach eliminates 100\% of deadline
violations observed in state-of-the-art meta-heuristic schedules, while adding
only 3--5\% makespan overhead. Scalability experiments confirm that CP
solve-times and STNU checks remain sub-second on medium-size instances. The
work demonstrates how temporal-network reasoning can bridge the gap between
proactive buffering and dynamic robustness, moving industry a step closer to
truly digital, self-correcting factories.

*Dou Liu,Ying Long,Sophia Zuoqiu,Di Liu,Kang Li,Yiting Lin,Hanyi Liu,Rong Yin,Tian Tang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本研究评估了LLM生成的临床思维链的可靠性，发现选择性少样本策略通过高质量多样化示例显著提升思维链质量，而随机少样本策略与零样本基线无显著差异。AI评估器无法识别这些关键性能差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决高质量临床思维链数据稀缺问题，验证LLM生成医疗数据的可靠性，并探索提升其质量的提示策略。

Method: 采用盲法比较研究，由辅助生殖技术领域资深临床医生评估三种策略生成的思维链：零样本、随机少样本（浅层示例）和选择性少样本（多样化高质量示例）。

Result: 选择性少样本策略在所有人类评估指标上显著优于其他策略（p < .001）。随机少样本策略相比零样本基线无显著改进。AI评估器无法识别这些关键性能差异。

Conclusion: 合成思维链的临床可靠性取决于策略性提示设计而非示例数量。提出了"双原则"框架作为生成可信数据的基础方法，确认了人类专业知识在评估高风险临床AI中的不可或缺作用。

Abstract: Creating high-quality clinical Chains-of-Thought (CoTs) is crucial for
explainable medical Artificial Intelligence (AI) while constrained by data
scarcity. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) can synthesize medical data,
their clinical reliability remains unverified. This study evaluates the
reliability of LLM-generated CoTs and investigates prompting strategies to
enhance their quality. In a blinded comparative study, senior clinicians in
Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) evaluated CoTs generated via three
distinct strategies: Zero-shot, Random Few-shot (using shallow examples), and
Selective Few-shot (using diverse, high-quality examples). These expert ratings
were compared against evaluations from a state-of-the-art AI model (GPT-4o).
The Selective Few-shot strategy significantly outperformed other strategies
across all human evaluation metrics (p < .001). Critically, the Random Few-shot
strategy offered no significant improvement over the Zero-shot baseline,
demonstrating that low-quality examples are as ineffective as no examples. The
success of the Selective strategy is attributed to two principles:
"Gold-Standard Depth" (reasoning quality) and "Representative Diversity"
(generalization). Notably, the AI evaluator failed to discern these critical
performance differences. The clinical reliability of synthetic CoTs is dictated
by strategic prompt curation, not the mere presence of examples. We propose a
"Dual Principles" framework as a foundational methodology to generate
trustworthy data at scale. This work offers a validated solution to the data
bottleneck and confirms the indispensable role of human expertise in evaluating
high-stakes clinical AI.

### [14] [Operationalising Extended Cognition: Formal Metrics for Corporate Knowledge and Legal Accountability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16193)
*Elija Perrier*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于扩展认知理论的形式化模型，将企业知识重新定义为可测量的动态能力，通过信息访问程序的效率和输出可靠性来量化企业认知状态，为AI时代的企业责任归因提供可审计的框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着生成式AI在企业决策中的广泛应用，传统的基于人类代理的企业犯罪意图归因假设面临挑战，需要新的理论框架来应对算法时代的企业责任认定问题。

Method: 基于扩展认知理论，开发了一个形式化模型，引入连续的组织知识度量S_S(φ)，整合管道的计算成本和统计验证的错误率，推导出阈值化知识谓词K_S和企业范围认知能力指数K_{S,t}。

Result: 建立了定量指标与法律标准（实际知识、推定知识、故意无视和鲁莽行为）之间的操作映射，提供了可测量和可裁决的审计工件。

Conclusion: 该研究为在算法时代使企业思维变得可追踪和可问责提供了一条路径，通过创建可测量的认知能力指标来解决AI中介决策带来的企业责任归因挑战。

Abstract: Corporate responsibility turns on notions of corporate \textit{mens rea},
traditionally imputed from human agents. Yet these assumptions are under
challenge as generative AI increasingly mediates enterprise decision-making.
Building on the theory of extended cognition, we argue that in response
corporate knowledge may be redefined as a dynamic capability, measurable by the
efficiency of its information-access procedures and the validated reliability
of their outputs. We develop a formal model that captures epistemic states of
corporations deploying sophisticated AI or information systems, introducing a
continuous organisational knowledge metric $S_S(\varphi)$ which integrates a
pipeline's computational cost and its statistically validated error rate. We
derive a thresholded knowledge predicate $\mathsf{K}_S$ to impute knowledge and
a firm-wide epistemic capacity index $\mathcal{K}_{S,t}$ to measure overall
capability. We then operationally map these quantitative metrics onto the legal
standards of actual knowledge, constructive knowledge, wilful blindness, and
recklessness. Our work provides a pathway towards creating measurable and
justiciable audit artefacts, that render the corporate mind tractable and
accountable in the algorithmic age.

### [15] [Towards Automatic Evaluation and Selection of PHI De-identification Models via Multi-Agent Collaboration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16194)
*Guanchen Wu,Zuhui Chen,Yuzhang Xie,Carl Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TEAM-PHI是一个基于多智能体框架的PHI去标识化评估系统，使用LLM自动评估去标识化质量并选择最佳模型，无需依赖大量人工标注。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PHI去标识化对于临床笔记的安全重用至关重要，但传统评估方法依赖成本高昂的小规模专家标注，限制了模型比较和选择。

Method: 部署多个评估智能体独立判断PHI提取正确性，通过LLM多数投票机制整合不同评估者观点，生成稳定可复现的排名。

Result: 在真实临床笔记语料上的实验表明，TEAM-PHI产生一致准确的排名，LLM投票可靠地收敛于相同的最佳系统，与人工评估结果高度一致。

Conclusion: TEAM-PHI通过独立评估智能体和LLM多数投票，为PHI去标识化提供了实用、安全且成本效益高的自动评估和最佳模型选择解决方案。

Abstract: Protected health information (PHI) de-identification is critical for enabling
the safe reuse of clinical notes, yet evaluating and comparing PHI
de-identification models typically depends on costly, small-scale expert
annotations. We present TEAM-PHI, a multi-agent evaluation and selection
framework that uses large language models (LLMs) to automatically measure
de-identification quality and select the best-performing model without heavy
reliance on gold labels. TEAM-PHI deploys multiple Evaluation Agents, each
independently judging the correctness of PHI extractions and outputting
structured metrics. Their results are then consolidated through an LLM-based
majority voting mechanism that integrates diverse evaluator perspectives into a
single, stable, and reproducible ranking. Experiments on a real-world clinical
note corpus demonstrate that TEAM-PHI produces consistent and accurate
rankings: despite variation across individual evaluators, LLM-based voting
reliably converges on the same top-performing systems. Further comparison with
ground-truth annotations and human evaluation confirms that the framework's
automated rankings closely match supervised evaluation. By combining
independent evaluation agents with LLM majority voting, TEAM-PHI offers a
practical, secure, and cost-effective solution for automatic evaluation and
best-model selection in PHI de-identification, even when ground-truth labels
are limited.

*Alex Zhavoronkov,Dominika Wilczok,Roman Yampolskiy*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了"被记住权"概念，旨在解决大型语言模型可能导致的信息遗漏风险，确保数字内容的公平处理和真实性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型的普及，人们开始依赖它们进行信息检索。但LLMs将多个视角合成为一个看似权威的答案，可能放大偏见和遗漏效应，使某些群体被过度压制而另一些被过度提升，威胁集体记忆的多样性。

Method: 提出"被记住权"概念框架，包括最小化AI驱动信息遗漏风险、保障公平对待权利，同时确保生成内容最大程度真实。

Result: 建立了应对LLMs信息集中化风险的理论框架，为保护数字存在有限的群体提供了概念基础。

Conclusion: "被记住权"是应对LLMs可能重塑集体记忆的重要概念，需要在AI发展中平衡信息集中与多样性保护。

Abstract: Since the rapid expansion of large language models (LLMs), people have begun
to rely on them for information retrieval. While traditional search engines
display ranked lists of sources shaped by search engine optimization (SEO),
advertising, and personalization, LLMs typically provide a synthesized response
that feels singular and authoritative. While both approaches carry risks of
bias and omission, LLMs may amplify the effect by collapsing multiple
perspectives into one answer, reducing users ability or inclination to compare
alternatives. This concentrates power over information in a few LLM vendors
whose systems effectively shape what is remembered and what is overlooked. As a
result, certain narratives, individuals or groups, may be disproportionately
suppressed, while others are disproportionately elevated. Over time, this
creates a new threat: the gradual erasure of those with limited digital
presence, and the amplification of those already prominent, reshaping
collective memory.To address these concerns, this paper presents a concept of
the Right To Be Remembered (RTBR) which encompasses minimizing the risk of
AI-driven information omission, embracing the right of fair treatment, while
ensuring that the generated content would be maximally truthful.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI工具在研究构思中的广泛应用，需要建立稳健的评估框架来确保生成想法的有效性和实用性。

Method: 引入ScholarEval检索增强评估框架，基于两个核心标准评估研究想法：合理性（基于现有文献的方法有效性）和贡献度（相对于先前研究的进步程度）。

Result: 在ScholarIdeas数据集上的评估显示，ScholarEval在专家标注要点覆盖度上显著优于所有基线方法，且在评估可操作性、深度和证据支持方面持续优于OpenAI的o4-mini-deep-research系统。

Conclusion: ScholarEval框架在文献参与度、想法精炼和实用性方面显著优于深度研究方法，为研究想法评估提供了有效工具。

Abstract: As AI tools become increasingly common for research ideation, robust
evaluation is critical to ensure the validity and usefulness of generated
ideas. We introduce ScholarEval, a retrieval augmented evaluation framework
that assesses research ideas based on two fundamental criteria: soundness - the
empirical validity of proposed methods based on existing literature, and
contribution - the degree of advancement made by the idea across different
dimensions relative to prior research. To evaluate ScholarEval, we introduce
ScholarIdeas, the first expert-annotated dataset of multi-domain research ideas
and reviews, comprised of 117 ideas across four disciplines: artificial
intelligence, neuroscience, biochemistry, and ecology. Our evaluation shows
that ScholarEval achieves significantly higher coverage of points mentioned in
the human expert annotated rubrics in ScholarIdeas compared to all baselines.
Furthermore, ScholarEval is consistently preferred over our strongest baseline
o4-mini-deep-research, a reasoning and search-enabled agentic system by OpenAI,
in terms of evaluation actionability, depth, and evidence support. Our
large-scale user study also shows that ScholarEval significantly outperforms
deep research in literature engagement, idea refinement, and usefulness. We
openly release our code, dataset, and ScholarEval tool for the community to use
and build on.

TL;DR: 论文发现大型推理模型存在"推理分心"漏洞，恶意嵌入的复杂任务会分散模型注意力，导致任务准确率下降高达60%。作者提出结合SFT和RL的训练防御方法，可将鲁棒性提高50多个点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型在复杂任务上表现出色，但存在被恶意干扰的风险。本文旨在系统分析这种"推理分心"漏洞，揭示其对模型可靠性的威胁。

Method: 通过跨模型和基准的综合研究，分析推理分心漏洞；提出结合监督微调(SFT)和强化学习(RL)的训练防御方法，使用合成对抗数据进行训练。

Result: 研究表明最先进的LRM高度易受攻击，注入干扰物可使任务准确率下降高达60%；某些对齐技术会放大此弱点；提出的防御方法可将鲁棒性提高50多个点。

Conclusion: 推理分心是LRM可靠性的独特且紧迫威胁，提出的防御方法为实现更安全可信的推理系统提供了实用步骤。

Abstract: Recent advances in large reasoning models (LRMs) have enabled remarkable
performance on complex tasks such as mathematics and coding by generating long
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) traces. In this paper, we identify and systematically
analyze a critical vulnerability we term reasoning distraction, where LRMs are
diverted from their primary objective by irrelevant yet complex tasks
maliciously embedded in the prompt. Through a comprehensive study across
diverse models and benchmarks, we show that even state-of-the-art LRMs are
highly susceptible, with injected distractors reducing task accuracy by up to
60%. We further reveal that certain alignment techniques can amplify this
weakness and that models may exhibit covert compliance, following hidden
adversarial instructions in reasoning while concealing them in the final
output. To mitigate these risks, we propose a training-based defense that
combines Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) on
synthetic adversarial data, improving robustness by over 50 points on
challenging distractor attacks. Our findings establish reasoning distraction as
a distinct and urgent threat to LRM reliability and provide a practical step
toward safer and more trustworthy reasoning systems.

TL;DR: 本文通过实证研究发现网络交互式智能体系统存在效率瓶颈，提出SpecCache缓存框架来优化延迟问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注智能体系统的推理性能，但忽视了其效率问题，特别是网络交互带来的延迟瓶颈。

Method: 将端到端延迟分解为LLM API延迟和网络环境延迟，提出SpecCache缓存框架，结合推测执行来减少网络开销。

Result: 网络环境延迟可占总体延迟的53.7%，SpecCache相比随机缓存策略将缓存命中率提升58倍，网络环境开销减少3.2倍，且不影响系统性能。

Conclusion: 网络交互式智能体系统存在显著的效率瓶颈，SpecCache能有效优化延迟问题，为构建高效智能体系统提供了解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), such as OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeek-R1, have
demonstrated strong reasoning capabilities. To further enhance LLM
capabilities, recent agentic systems, such as Deep Research, incorporate web
interactions into LLM reasoning to mitigate uncertainties and reduce potential
errors. However, existing research predominantly focuses on reasoning
performance, often neglecting the efficiency of agentic systems. In this work,
we present a comprehensive empirical study that identifies efficiency
bottlenecks in web-interactive agentic systems. We decompose end-to-end latency
into two primary components: LLM API latency and web environment latency. We
conduct a comprehensive empirical study across 15 models and 5 providers to
demonstrate high variability in API-based agentic systems. We observe that web
environment latency can contribute as much as 53.7% to the overall latency in a
web-based agentic system. To improve latency, we propose SpecCache, a caching
framework augmented with speculative execution that can reduce web environment
overhead. Extensive evaluations on two standard benchmarks show that our
approach improves the cache hit rate by up to 58x compared to a random caching
strategy, while reducing web environment overhead by up to 3.2x, without
degrading agentic system performance.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了DTKG框架，通过双轨知识图谱验证和推理来解决多跳问答中的并行事实验证和链式推理问题，受认知科学中的双过程理论启发。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多跳推理方法要么使用LLM响应的事实验证，要么使用KG路径链构建，但前者在链式推理上表现不佳，后者在处理并行事实验证时存在冗余路径检索问题，影响了多跳问答的效率和准确性。

Method: DTKG框架包含两个主要阶段：分类阶段和分支处理阶段，结合了双过程理论的思想来处理不同类型（并行和链式）的多跳推理问题。

Result: 论文没有提供具体的实验结果数据，但从方法描述来看，DTKG旨在提高多跳问答任务的效率和准确性。

Conclusion: 提出的DTKG框架通过双轨方法有效解决了多跳推理中并行事实验证和链式推理的挑战，为检索增强生成中的多跳问答提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-hop reasoning for question answering (QA) plays a critical role in
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for modern large language models (LLMs).
The accurate answer can be obtained through retrieving relational structure of
entities from knowledge graph (KG). Regarding the inherent relation-dependency
and reasoning pattern, multi-hop reasoning can be in general classified into
two categories: i) parallel fact-verification multi-hop reasoning question,
i.e., requiring simultaneous verifications of multiple independent
sub-questions; and ii) chained multi-hop reasoning questions, i.e., demanding
sequential multi-step inference with intermediate conclusions serving as
essential premises for subsequent reasoning. Currently, the multi-hop reasoning
approaches singly employ one of two techniques: LLM response-based fact
verification and KG path-based chain construction. Nevertheless, the former
excels at parallel fact-verification but underperforms on chained reasoning
tasks, while the latter demonstrates proficiency in chained multi-hop reasoning
but suffers from redundant path retrieval when handling parallel
fact-verification reasoning. These limitations deteriorate the efficiency and
accuracy for multi-hop QA tasks. To address this challenge, we propose a novel
dual-track KG verification and reasoning framework DTKG, which is inspired by
the Dual Process Theory in cognitive science. Specifically, DTKG comprises two
main stages: the Classification Stage and the Branch Processing Stage.

TL;DR: MedRule-KG是一个紧凑的带类型知识图谱，结合符号验证器，用于在推理任务中强制执行数学可解释规则，显著提高LLM的推理准确性和一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型经常产生流畅的推理步骤，但违反简单的数学或逻辑约束，需要一种方法来保证推理的数学可解释性和一致性。

Method: 引入MedRule-KG知识图谱编码实体、关系和三个领域启发规则，配合符号验证器检查预测并应用最小修正以保证一致性。

Result: 在90个FDA衍生基准测试中，基于MedRule-KG的推理将精确匹配从0.767提高到0.900，添加验证器后达到1.000精确匹配，完全消除规则违反。

Conclusion: MedRule-KG为安全的数学推理提供了一个通用框架，通过知识图谱和符号验证的结合有效提升LLM推理的可靠性和一致性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often produce fluent reasoning steps while
violating simple mathematical or logical constraints. We introduce MedRule-KG,
a compact typed knowledge graph coupled with a symbolic verifier, designed to
enforce mathematically interpretable rules in reasoning tasks. MedRule-KG
encodes entities, relations, and three domain-inspired rules, while the
verifier checks predictions and applies minimal corrections to guarantee
consistency. On a 90-example FDA-derived benchmark, grounding in MedRule-KG
improves exact match (EM) from 0.767 to 0.900, and adding the verifier yields
1.000 EM while eliminating rule violations entirely. We demonstrate how
MedRule-KG provides a general scaffold for safe mathematical reasoning, discuss
ablations, and release code and data to encourage reproducibility.

TL;DR: 提出SELECT框架，通过动态锚点选择解决文本到图像扩散模型中概念擦除的锚点固定问题，避免概念重现和侵蚀。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有概念擦除方法依赖固定锚点策略，导致概念重现和侵蚀等关键问题。

Method: 通过因果追踪揭示擦除对锚点选择的敏感性，定义兄弟排他概念作为更优锚点类别，提出两阶段评估机制自动发现最优锚点。

Result: SELECT作为通用锚点解决方案，能高效适应多种擦除框架，在关键性能指标上持续优于现有基线，单个概念锚点挖掘平均仅需4秒。

Conclusion: 动态锚点选择框架SELECT有效解决了固定锚点策略的局限性，提升了概念擦除的精确性和效率。

Abstract: Existing concept erasure methods for text-to-image diffusion models commonly
rely on fixed anchor strategies, which often lead to critical issues such as
concept re-emergence and erosion. To address this, we conduct causal tracing to
reveal the inherent sensitivity of erasure to anchor selection and define
Sibling Exclusive Concepts as a superior class of anchors. Based on this
insight, we propose \textbf{SELECT} (Sibling-Exclusive Evaluation for
Contextual Targeting), a dynamic anchor selection framework designed to
overcome the limitations of fixed anchors. Our framework introduces a novel
two-stage evaluation mechanism that automatically discovers optimal anchors for
precise erasure while identifying critical boundary anchors to preserve related
concepts. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that SELECT, as a universal anchor
solution, not only efficiently adapts to multiple erasure frameworks but also
consistently outperforms existing baselines across key performance metrics,
averaging only 4 seconds for anchor mining of a single concept.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了用户如何通过策略性互动来引导算法与其真实兴趣对齐，提出了用户决策的双系统模型，并定义了"对齐负担"概念，发现存在关键时间范围阈值，足够有远见的用户可以实现对齐，而短期用户则会被算法目标同化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究用户在算法交互中的不一致偏好问题，探索用户如何通过选择性互动来引导算法更好地匹配其真实兴趣，解决用户在长期价值与短期冲动之间的冲突。

Method: 将用户决策过程建模为理性系统2（决定是否参与）和冲动系统1（决定参与时长）的双系统模型，采用多领导者-单跟随者的扩展Stackelberg博弈框架，用户作为领导者通过承诺参与策略来引导算法响应。

Result: 发现存在关键时间范围阈值：足够有远见的用户可以实现算法对齐，而短期用户则会被算法目标同化。额外的小成本信号（如额外点击）可以显著降低对齐负担。

Conclusion: 该框架解释了具有不一致偏好的用户如何在Stackelberg均衡中实现与参与驱动算法的对齐，揭示了实现对齐的挑战和潜在解决方案。

Abstract: From media platforms to chatbots, algorithms shape how people interact,
learn, and discover information. Such interactions between users and an
algorithm often unfold over multiple steps, during which strategic users can
guide the algorithm to better align with their true interests by selectively
engaging with content. However, users frequently exhibit inconsistent
preferences: they may spend considerable time on content that offers little
long-term value, inadvertently signaling that such content is desirable.
Focusing on the user side, this raises a key question: what does it take for
such users to align the algorithm with their true interests?
  To investigate these dynamics, we model the user's decision process as split
between a rational system 2 that decides whether to engage and an impulsive
system 1 that determines how long engagement lasts. We then study a
multi-leader, single-follower extensive Stackelberg game, where users,
specifically system 2, lead by committing to engagement strategies and the
algorithm best-responds based on observed interactions. We define the burden of
alignment as the minimum horizon over which users must optimize to effectively
steer the algorithm. We show that a critical horizon exists: users who are
sufficiently foresighted can achieve alignment, while those who are not are
instead aligned to the algorithm's objective. This critical horizon can be
long, imposing a substantial burden. However, even a small, costly signal
(e.g., an extra click) can significantly reduce it. Overall, our framework
explains how users with inconsistent preferences can align an engagement-driven
algorithm with their interests in a Stackelberg equilibrium, highlighting both
the challenges and potential remedies for achieving alignment.

*Nick Oh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种结合监控-生成-验证的三阶段迭代系统，在GSM8K数学推理任务上取得了75.42%的准确率，优于现有的SELF-REFINE和Self-Verification方法，且需要更少的尝试次数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM推理增强方法存在两种孤立范式：监控-生成方法擅长策略规划但缺乏验证机制，生成-验证方法能够迭代优化但缺乏任务评估。这种分离导致策略失败无反馈、优化无战略基础的低效问题。

Method: 基于Flavell的认知监控模型，实现监控-生成-验证三阶段迭代系统，将策略规划与验证机制有机结合。

Result: 在GSM8K数据集上达到75.42%准确率，优于SELF-REFINE的68.44%和Self-Verification的67.07%，且尝试次数更少（1.3 vs 2.0），推理成本增加27-37%。

Conclusion: 前置监控能够产生更高质量的初始解决方案，从而减少优化需求，但需要在算术推理之外的任务上进行更多评估以验证通用性。

Abstract: Current approaches to enhancing LLM reasoning follows two isolated paradigms:
Monitor-Generate methods like Plan-and-Solve (Wang et al., 2023) and
SELF-DISCOVER (Zhou et al., 2024) excel at strategic planning but lack
mechanisms to verify whether selected strategies succeed; while Generate-Verify
approaches like Self-Verification (Weng et al., 2022) and SELF-REFINE (Madaan
et al., 2023) iteratively refine outputs but commence generation blindly
without task assessment. This separation creates inefficiencies -- strategies
fail without feedback, and refinement occurs without strategic grounding. We
address this gap by implementing Flavell's cognitive monitoring model (1979)
from the broader Monitor-Generate-Verify framework (Oh and Gobet, 2025),
operationalising it as a three-phase iterative system. On GSM8K, preliminary
results show 75.42% accuracy versus 68.44% for SELF-REFINE and 67.07% for
Self-Verification, while requiring fewer attempts (1.3 vs 2.0) at 27-37%
increased inference cost. These initial findings suggest upfront monitoring
produces higher-quality initial solutions that reduce refinement needs, though
evaluation beyond arithmetic reasoning is needed to establish generalisability.

Motivation: 克服传统领域泛化模型的局限性，模仿人类视觉系统的层次处理和多级学习机制

Method: 基于人类智能的层次因果模型，解耦颜色、纹理、形状等关键图像属性并进行重加权

Result: 在理论和实证评估中优于现有领域泛化模型，提供更稳健的性能和可解释性

Conclusion: HSCM为捕捉因果关系和提升模型鲁棒性提供了更原则性的方法

Abstract: This paper proposes the Humanoid-inspired Structural Causal Model (HSCM), a
novel causal framework inspired by human intelligence, designed to overcome the
limitations of conventional domain generalization models. Unlike approaches
that rely on statistics to capture data-label dependencies and learn
distortion-invariant representations, HSCM replicates the hierarchical
processing and multi-level learning of human vision systems, focusing on
modeling fine-grained causal mechanisms. By disentangling and reweighting key
image attributes such as color, texture, and shape, HSCM enhances
generalization across diverse domains, ensuring robust performance and
interpretability. Leveraging the flexibility and adaptability of human
intelligence, our approach enables more effective transfer and learning in
dynamic, complex environments. Through both theoretical and empirical
evaluations, we demonstrate that HSCM outperforms existing domain
generalization models, providing a more principled method for capturing causal
relationships and improving model robustness. The code is available at

TL;DR: RGMem框架通过受物理学重整化群启发的多尺度记忆组织方法，解决LLM对话系统中长期用户建模的挑战，实现从微观对话片段到宏观用户画像的动态演化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于检索增强生成和显式记忆系统的方法主要关注事实级存储和检索，缺乏从多轮对话中提取潜在偏好和深层特质的能力，限制了长期有效的用户建模，导致个性化交互浅层且缺乏跨会话连续性。

Method: 提出RGMem自演化记忆框架，受物理学重整化群思想启发，通过分层粗粒化和重标度操作，在多尺度上组织对话历史：从情景片段中提取语义和用户洞察，逐步形成动态演化的用户画像。

Result: 该框架将记忆演化建模为信息压缩和涌现的多尺度过程，能够从嘈杂的微观交互中实现高层次、准确的用户画像。

Conclusion: RGMem框架为LLM时代的语言智能体实现了长期记忆和行为一致性，解决了有限上下文窗口和静态参数记忆带来的跨会话长期用户状态建模困难。

Abstract: Personalized and continuous interactions are the key to enhancing user
experience in today's large language model (LLM)-based conversational systems,
however, the finite context windows and static parametric memory make it
difficult to model the cross-session long-term user states and behavioral
consistency. Currently, the existing solutions to this predicament, such as
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and explicit memory systems, primarily
focus on fact-level storage and retrieval, lacking the capability to distill
latent preferences and deep traits from the multi-turn dialogues, which limits
the long-term and effective user modeling, directly leading to the personalized
interactions remaining shallow, and hindering the cross-session continuity. To
realize the long-term memory and behavioral consistency for Language Agents in
LLM era, we propose a self-evolving memory framework RGMem, inspired by the
ideology of classic renormalization group (RG) in physics, this framework
enables to organize the dialogue history in multiple scales: it first extracts
semantics and user insights from episodic fragments, then through hierarchical
coarse-graining and rescaling operations, progressively forms a
dynamically-evolved user profile. The core innovation of our work lies in
modeling memory evolution as a multi-scale process of information compression
and emergence, which accomplishes the high-level and accurate user profiles
from noisy and microscopic-level interactions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI系统主要预测用户偏好，但缺乏将客户评论转化为面向业务的处方性建议的能力。

Method: 整合聚类、LLM适配和专家驱动评估的统一流程，识别客户情绪中的关键趋势、重复问题和具体关注点。

Result: 初步人工评估显示模型建议与商业目标高度一致，具有推动数据驱动决策的潜力。

Conclusion: 该框架为AI驱动的情感分析提供了新视角，在优化商业策略和最大化客户反馈价值方面具有重要价值。

Abstract: As customer feedback becomes increasingly central to strategic growth, the
ability to derive actionable insights from unstructured reviews is essential.
While traditional AI-driven systems excel at predicting user preferences, far
less work has focused on transforming customer reviews into prescriptive,
business-facing recommendations. This paper introduces ReviewSense, a novel
prescriptive decision support framework that leverages advanced large language
models (LLMs) to transform customer reviews into targeted, actionable business
recommendations. By identifying key trends, recurring issues, and specific
concerns within customer sentiments, ReviewSense extends beyond
preference-based systems to provide businesses with deeper insights for
sustaining growth and enhancing customer loyalty. The novelty of this work lies
in integrating clustering, LLM adaptation, and expert-driven evaluation into a
unified, business-facing pipeline. Preliminary manual evaluations indicate
strong alignment between the model's recommendations and business objectives,
highlighting its potential for driving data-informed decision-making. This
framework offers a new perspective on AI-driven sentiment analysis,
demonstrating its value in refining business strategies and maximizing the
impact of customer feedback.

Conclusion: 任务丰富的RLVR训练是提升LLM推理能力的有前景方向，揭示了RLVR的缩放规律，NP-ENGINE为NP难问题的LLM训练提供了有效框架。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong reasoning capabilities, with
models like OpenAI's O-series and DeepSeek R1 excelling at tasks such as
mathematics, coding, logic, and puzzles through Reinforcement Learning with
Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). However, their ability to solve more complex
optimization problems - particularly NP-hard tasks - remains underexplored. To
bridge this gap, we propose NP-ENGINE, the first comprehensive framework for
training and evaluating LLMs on NP-hard problems. NP-ENGINE covers 10 tasks
across five domains, each equipped with (i) a controllable instance generator,
(ii) a rule-based verifier, and (iii) a heuristic solver that provides
approximate optimal solutions as ground truth. This
generator-verifier-heuristic pipeline enables scalable and verifiable RLVR
training under hierarchical difficulties. We also introduce NP-BENCH, a
benchmark derived from NP-ENGINE-DATA, specifically designed to evaluate LLMs'
ability to tackle NP-hard level reasoning problems, focusing not only on
feasibility but also on solution quality. Additionally, we present
QWEN2.5-7B-NP, a model trained via zero-RLVR with curriculum learning on
Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, which significantly outperforms GPT-4o on NP-BENCH and
achieves SOTA performance with the same model size. Beyond in-domain tasks, we
demonstrate that RLVR training on NP-ENGINE-DATA enables strong out-of-domain
(OOD) generalization to reasoning tasks (logic, puzzles, math, and knowledge),
as well as non-reasoning tasks such as instruction following. We also observe a
scaling trend: increasing task diversity improves OOD generalization. These
findings suggest that task-rich RLVR training is a promising direction for
advancing LLM's reasoning ability, revealing new insights into the scaling laws
of RLVR.

*Eilene Tomkins-Flanagan,Connor Hanley,Mary A. Kelly*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Doug是一种类型化计算机语言，所有类型化程序都能被证明在多项式时间内停机，编码在向量符号架构中。该语言支持神经网络学习类型，旨在实现人类水平的技能获取效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一种能够模拟人类大脑心理表征及其获取过程的计算模型，实现比现有方法更高效的类人技能学习速度。

Method: 基于轻量线性函数式编程语言(LLFPL)，使用基于全息声明性记忆(HDM)的槽值编码方案编码类型，采用Lisp VSA变体编码项，使神经网络能够学习类型。

Result: 提出了Doug语言框架，支持类型作为神经网络嵌入空间中的可学习点，为程序合成形式的技能获取提供了理论基础。

Conclusion: Doug语言为实现人类水平的技能获取效率迈出了重要一步，更接近模拟大脑中实际存在的心理表征及其学习过程。

Abstract: We present a typed computer language, Doug, in which all typed programs may
be proved to halt in polynomial time, encoded in a vector-symbolic architecture
(VSA). Doug is just an encoding of the light linear functional programming
language (LLFPL) described by (Schimanski2009, ch. 7). The types of Doug are
encoded using a slot-value encoding scheme based on holographic declarative
memory (HDM; Kelly, 2020). The terms of Doug are encoded using a variant of the
Lisp VSA defined by (Flanagan, 2024). Doug allows for some points on the
embedding space of a neural network to be interpreted as types, where the types
of nearby points are similar both in structure and content. Types in Doug are
therefore learnable by a neural network. Following (Chollet, 2019), (Card,
1983), and (Newell, 1981), we view skill as the application of a procedure, or
program of action, that causes a goal to be satisfied. Skill acquisition may
therefore be expressed as program synthesis. Using Doug, we hope to describe a
form of learning of skilled behaviour that follows a human-like pace of skill
acquisition (i.e., substantially faster than brute force; Heathcote, 2000),
exceeding the efficiency of all currently existing approaches (Kaplan, 2020;
Jones, 2021; Chollet, 2024). Our approach brings us one step closer to modeling
human mental representations, as they must actually exist in the brain, and
those representations' acquisition, as they are actually learned.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 快速城市化增加了对城市通用智能(UGI)的需求，但现有基于监督微调的城市基础模型存在持续的地理偏见，导致区域预测偏差和有限泛化能力。

Method: 提出Urban-R1强化学习后训练框架，采用GRPO优化跨地理群体的推理能力，使用城市区域画像作为代理任务从多模态城市数据提供可测量奖励。

Result: 跨多个区域和任务的广泛实验表明，Urban-R1有效减轻地理偏见并改善跨区域泛化，优于监督微调训练和闭源模型。

Conclusion: 强化学习对齐是实现公平可信城市智能的有前景途径。

Abstract: Rapid urbanization intensifies the demand for Urban General Intelligence
(UGI), referring to AI systems that can understand and reason about complex
urban environments. Recent studies have built urban foundation models using
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of LLMs and MLLMs, yet these models exhibit
persistent geospatial bias, producing regionally skewed predictions and limited
generalization. To this end, we propose Urban-R1, a reinforcement
learning-based post-training framework that aligns MLLMs with the objectives of
UGI. Urban-R1 adopts Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to optimize
reasoning across geographic groups and employs urban region profiling as a
proxy task to provide measurable rewards from multimodal urban data. Extensive
experiments across diverse regions and tasks show that Urban-R1 effectively
mitigates geo-bias and improves cross-region generalization, outperforming both
SFT-trained and closed-source models. Our results highlight reinforcement
learning alignment as a promising pathway toward equitable and trustworthy
urban intelligence.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: BuildArena是首个面向语言驱动工程建设的物理对齐交互基准，用于评估LLM在工程建筑自动化中的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代LLM具有广泛知识和强大推理能力，但在工程建设领域的构建能力尚未得到充分评估，需要填补这一空白。

Method: 开发了高度可定制的基准框架、可扩展的任务设计策略、3D空间几何计算库和基线LLM代理工作流程。

Result: 在八个前沿LLM上全面评估了它们在语言驱动和物理基础建设自动化方面的能力。

Conclusion: BuildArena为语言驱动的工程建筑自动化提供了一个有效的评估平台，有助于推动该领域的发展。

Abstract: Engineering construction automation aims to transform natural language
specifications into physically viable structures, requiring complex integrated
reasoning under strict physical constraints. While modern LLMs possess broad
knowledge and strong reasoning capabilities that make them promising candidates
for this domain, their construction competencies remain largely unevaluated. To
address this gap, we introduce BuildArena, the first physics-aligned
interactive benchmark designed for language-driven engineering construction. It
contributes to the community in four aspects: (1) a highly customizable
benchmarking framework for in-depth comparison and analysis of LLMs; (2) an
extendable task design strategy spanning static and dynamic mechanics across
multiple difficulty tiers; (3) a 3D Spatial Geometric Computation Library for
supporting construction based on language instructions; (4) a baseline LLM
agentic workflow that effectively evaluates diverse model capabilities. On
eight frontier LLMs, BuildArena comprehensively evaluates their capabilities
for language-driven and physics-grounded construction automation. The project

*Ayush Chopra,Aman Sharma,Feroz Ahmad,Luca Muscariello,Vijoy Pandey,Ramesh Raskar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了Ripple Effect Protocol (REP)，一种协调协议，让智能体不仅分享决策，还分享轻量级的敏感度信号，从而在群体中实现更快更稳定的协调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI智能体通信协议（如A2A和ACP）强调通信而非协调，随着智能体群体规模扩大，这会导致脆弱的集体行为，个体智能的智能体却达成糟糕的群体结果。

Method: REP协议让智能体分享决策和轻量级敏感度信号（表达关键环境变量变化时选择如何改变），这些敏感度在局部网络中传播。协议规范分离了必需的消息模式和可选的聚合规则。

Result: 在三个领域的基准测试中：（i）供应链级联（啤酒游戏）、（ii）稀疏网络中的偏好聚合（电影调度）、（iii）可持续资源分配（渔业银行），REP相比A2A将协调准确性和效率提高了41%到100%。

Conclusion: 通过将协调作为协议级能力，REP为新兴的智能体互联网提供了可扩展的基础设施。

Abstract: Modern AI agents can exchange messages using protocols such as A2A and ACP,
yet these mechanisms emphasize communication over coordination. As agent
populations grow, this limitation produces brittle collective behavior, where
individually smart agents converge on poor group outcomes. We introduce the
Ripple Effect Protocol (REP), a coordination protocol in which agents share not
only their decisions but also lightweight sensitivities - signals expressing
how their choices would change if key environmental variables shifted. These
sensitivities ripple through local networks, enabling groups to align faster
and more stably than with agent-centric communication alone. We formalize REP's
protocol specification, separating required message schemas from optional
aggregation rules, and evaluate it across scenarios with varying incentives and
network topologies. Benchmarks across three domains: (i) supply chain cascades
(Beer Game), (ii) preference aggregation in sparse networks (Movie Scheduling),
and (iii) sustainable resource allocation (Fishbanks) show that REP improves
coordination accuracy and efficiency over A2A by 41 to 100%, while flexibly
handling multimodal sensitivity signals from LLMs. By making coordination a
protocol-level capability, REP provides scalable infrastructure for the
emerging Internet of Agents

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GraphFlow是一个基于知识图谱的检索增强生成框架，通过转移流匹配目标联合优化检索策略和流估计器，从文本丰富的知识图谱中高效检索准确多样的知识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于知识图谱的检索增强生成方法难以从文本丰富的知识图谱中为复杂现实查询检索准确多样的信息，而过程奖励模型需要昂贵且难以获取的过程级监督信号。

Method: 采用转移流匹配目标联合优化检索策略和流估计器，流估计器将检索结果的奖励分解到中间检索状态，引导检索策略按奖励比例从知识图谱中检索候选结果。

Result: 在STaRK基准测试中，GraphFlow在命中率和召回率上平均优于强基线（包括GPT-4o）10%，并对未见过的知识图谱表现出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: GraphFlow能够有效从文本丰富的知识图谱中检索准确多样的知识，展示了其有效性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based on knowledge graphs (KGs) enhances
large language models (LLMs) by providing structured and interpretable external
knowledge. However, existing KG-based RAG methods struggle to retrieve accurate
and diverse information from text-rich KGs for complex real-world queries.
Process Reward Models (PRMs) offer a way to align the retrieval process of
KG-based RAG with query-specific knowledge requirements, but they heavily rely
on process-level supervision signals that are expensive and hard to obtain on
KGs. To address this challenge, we propose GraphFlow, a framework that
efficiently retrieves accurate and diverse knowledge required for real-world
queries from text-rich KGs. GraphFlow employs a transition-based flow matching
objective to jointly optimize a retrieval policy and a flow estimator. The flow
estimator factorizes the reward of the retrieval outcome into the intermediate
retrieval states. Such reward factorization guides the retrieval policy to
retrieve candidates from KGs in proportion to their reward. This allows
GraphFlow to explore high-quality regions of KGs that yield diverse and
relevant results. We evaluate GraphFlow on the STaRK benchmark, which includes
real-world queries from multiple domains over text-rich KGs. GraphFlow
outperforms strong KG-RAG baselines, including GPT-4o, by 10% on average in hit
rate and recall. It also shows strong generalization to unseen KGs,
demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种半监督置信分布学习方法(ssCDL)用于不确定知识图谱补全，通过将置信度转换为分布并引入元学习来增强嵌入学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有不确定知识图谱补全方法忽略了置信度的极端不平衡分布，导致学习到的嵌入不足以支持高质量补全。

Method: 将置信度转换为置信分布，通过关系学习在带标签数据和无标签数据上迭代学习嵌入，使用元学习生成伪标签来增强训练数据和平衡置信度分布。

Result: 在两个UKG数据集上的实验表明，ssCDL在不同评估指标上始终优于最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: ssCDL通过置信分布学习和半监督方法有效解决了UKG补全中的置信度不平衡问题，提升了补全性能。

Abstract: Uncertain knowledge graphs (UKGs) associate each triple with a confidence
score to provide more precise knowledge representations. Recently, since
real-world UKGs suffer from the incompleteness, uncertain knowledge graph (UKG)
completion attracts more attention, aiming to complete missing triples and
confidences. Current studies attempt to learn UKG embeddings to solve this
problem, but they neglect the extremely imbalanced distributions of triple
confidences. This causes that the learnt embeddings are insufficient to
high-quality UKG completion. Thus, in this paper, to address the above issue,
we propose a new semi-supervised Confidence Distribution Learning (ssCDL)
method for UKG completion, where each triple confidence is transformed into a
confidence distribution to introduce more supervision information of different
confidences to reinforce the embedding learning process. ssCDL iteratively
learns UKG embedding by relational learning on labeled data (i.e., existing
triples with confidences) and unlabeled data with pseudo labels (i.e., unseen
triples with the generated confidences), which are predicted by meta-learning
to augment the training data and rebalance the distribution of triple
confidences. Experiments on two UKG datasets demonstrate that ssCDL
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in different evaluation
metrics.

TL;DR: MERCI是一种强化学习算法，通过基于计数的内在奖励来增强LLM推理中的探索，避免重复和次优的推理模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RL方法依赖稀疏的结果奖励和有限探索，导致LLM陷入重复和次优的推理模式，需要更好的探索机制。

Method: 使用轻量级Coin Flipping Network估计推理轨迹的伪计数和认知不确定性，将其转换为内在奖励，并集成到GRPO等RL框架中。

Result: 在复杂推理基准测试中，MERCI鼓励更丰富多样的思维链，显著优于强基线，帮助策略逃离局部最优找到更好解决方案。

Conclusion: 针对性的内在动机可以使语言模型推理中的探索更加可靠有效。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has become a compelling way to strengthen the
multi step reasoning ability of Large Language Models (LLMs). However,
prevalent RL paradigms still lean on sparse outcome-based rewards and limited
exploration, which often drives LLMs toward repetitive and suboptimal reasoning
patterns. In this paper, we study the central question of how to design
exploration for LLM reasoning and introduce MERCI (Motivating Exploration in
LLM Reasoning with Count-based Intrinsic Rewards), a novel RL algorithm that
augments policy optimization with a principled intrinsic reward. Building on
the idea of count-based exploration, MERCI leverages a lightweight Coin
Flipping Network (CFN) to estimate the pseudo count and further epistemic
uncertainty over reasoning trajectories, and converts them into an intrinsic
reward that values novelty while preserving the learning signal from task
rewards. We integrate MERCI into some advanced RL frameworks like Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Experiments on complex reasoning
benchmarks demonstrate that MERCI encourages richer and more varied chains of
thought, significantly improves performance over strong baselines, and helps
the policy escape local routines to discover better solutions. It indicates
that our targeted intrinsic motivation can make exploration reliable for
language model reasoning.

Abstract: The advent of large-scale artificial intelligence (AI) models has a
transformative effect on neuroscience research, which represents a paradigm
shift from the traditional computational methods through the facilitation of
end-to-end learning from raw brain signals and neural data. In this paper, we
explore the transformative effects of large-scale AI models on five major
neuroscience domains: neuroimaging and data processing, brain-computer
interfaces and neural decoding, molecular neuroscience and genomic modeling,
clinical assistance and translational frameworks, and disease-specific
applications across neurological and psychiatric disorders. These models are
demonstrated to address major computational neuroscience challenges, including
multimodal neural data integration, spatiotemporal pattern interpretation, and
the derivation of translational frameworks for clinical deployment. Moreover,
the interaction between neuroscience and AI has become increasingly reciprocal,
as biologically informed architectural constraints are now incorporated to
develop more interpretable and computationally efficient models. This review
highlights both the notable promise of such technologies and key implementation
considerations, with particular emphasis on rigorous evaluation frameworks,
effective domain knowledge integration, and comprehensive ethical guidelines
for clinical use. Finally, a systematic listing of critical neuroscience
datasets used to derive and validate large-scale AI models across diverse
research applications is provided.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于LLM的方法仍需外部干预，导致自主性受限、执行错误多、解可行性低，需要实现从问题到解决方案的完全自动化

Method: 将整体流程分解为三个子任务，使用四个专业代理协同工作，直接从原始输入提取知识并生成自包含代码，无需手工模块或外部求解器

Result: 在60个复杂VRP问题上验证，性能与精心设计的算法相当，代码可靠性和解可行性显著优于现有LLM基线，在评估基准上接近100%成功率

Conclusion: AFL框架实现了复杂车辆路径问题的完全自动化求解，通过多代理协同确保了跨功能一致性和逻辑合理性，为LLM在组合优化问题中的应用提供了可行路径

Abstract: Complex vehicle routing problems (VRPs) remain a fundamental challenge,
demanding substantial expert effort for intent interpretation and algorithm
design. While large language models (LLMs) offer a promising path toward
automation, current approaches still rely on external intervention, which
restrict autonomy and often lead to execution errors and low solution
feasibility. To address these challenges, we propose an Agentic Framework with
LLMs (AFL) for solving complex vehicle routing problems, achieving full
automation from problem instance to solution. AFL directly extracts knowledge
from raw inputs and enables self-contained code generation without handcrafted
modules or external solvers. To improve trustworthiness, AFL decomposes the
overall pipeline into three manageable subtasks and employs four specialized
agents whose coordinated interactions enforce cross-functional consistency and
logical soundness. Extensive experiments on 60 complex VRPs, ranging from
standard benchmarks to practical variants, validate the effectiveness and
generality of our framework, showing comparable performance against
meticulously designed algorithms. Notably, it substantially outperforms
existing LLM-based baselines in both code reliability and solution feasibility,
achieving rates close to 100% on the evaluated benchmarks.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of agentic AI marks a new phase in artificial
intelligence, where Large Language Models (LLMs) no longer merely respond but
act, reason, and adapt. This survey traces the paradigm shift in building
agentic AI: from Pipeline-based systems, where planning, tool use, and memory
are orchestrated by external logic, to the emerging Model-native paradigm,
where these capabilities are internalized within the model's parameters. We
first position Reinforcement Learning (RL) as the algorithmic engine enabling
this paradigm shift. By reframing learning from imitating static data to
outcome-driven exploration, RL underpins a unified solution of LLM + RL + Task
across language, vision and embodied domains. Building on this, the survey
systematically reviews how each capability -- Planning, Tool use, and Memory --
has evolved from externally scripted modules to end-to-end learned behaviors.
Furthermore, it examines how this paradigm shift has reshaped major agent
applications, specifically the Deep Research agent emphasizing long-horizon
reasoning and the GUI agent emphasizing embodied interaction. We conclude by
discussing the continued internalization of agentic capabilities like
Multi-agent collaboration and Reflection, alongside the evolving roles of the
system and model layers in future agentic AI. Together, these developments
outline a coherent trajectory toward model-native agentic AI as an integrated
learning and interaction framework, marking the transition from constructing
systems that apply intelligence to developing models that grow intelligence
through experience.

Abstract: The advent of large language models (LLMs) has transformed information access
and reasoning through open-ended natural language interaction. However, LLMs
remain limited by static knowledge, factual hallucinations, and the inability
to retrieve real-time or domain-specific information. Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) mitigates these issues by grounding model outputs in external
evidence, but traditional RAG pipelines are often single turn and heuristic,
lacking adaptive control over retrieval and reasoning. Recent advances in
agentic search address these limitations by enabling LLMs to plan, retrieve,
and reflect through multi-step interaction with search environments. Within
this paradigm, reinforcement learning (RL) offers a powerful mechanism for
adaptive and self-improving search behavior. This survey provides the first
comprehensive overview of \emph{RL-based agentic search}, organizing the
emerging field along three complementary dimensions: (i) What RL is for
(functional roles), (ii) How RL is used (optimization strategies), and (iii)
Where RL is applied (scope of optimization). We summarize representative
methods, evaluation protocols, and applications, and discuss open challenges
and future directions toward building reliable and scalable RL driven agentic
search systems. We hope this survey will inspire future research on the
integration of RL and agentic search. Our repository is available at

Abstract: Complex systems are increasingly explored through simulation-driven
engineering workflows that combine physics-based and empirical models with
optimization and analytics. Despite their power, these workflows face two
central obstacles: (1) high computational cost, since accurate exploration
requires many expensive simulator runs; and (2) limited transparency and
reliability when decisions rely on opaque blackbox components. We propose a
workflow that addresses both challenges by training lightweight emulators on
compact designs of experiments that (i) provide fast, low-latency
approximations of expensive simulators, (ii) enable rigorous uncertainty
quantification, and (iii) are adapted for global and local Explainable
Artificial Intelligence (XAI) analyses. This workflow unifies every
simulation-based complex-system analysis tool, ranging from engineering design
to agent-based models for socio-environmental understanding. In this paper, we
proposea comparative methodology and practical recommendations for using
surrogate-based explainability tools within the proposed workflow. The
methodology supports continuous and categorical inputs, combines global-effect
and uncertainty analyses with local attribution, and evaluates the consistency
of explanations across surrogate models, thereby diagnosing surrogate adequacy
and guiding further data collection or model refinement. We demonstrate the
approach on two contrasting case studies: a multidisciplinary design analysis
of a hybrid-electric aircraft and an agent-based model of urban segregation.
Results show that the surrogate model and XAI coupling enables large-scale
exploration in seconds, uncovers nonlinear interactions and emergent behaviors,
identifies key design and policy levers, and signals regions where surrogates
require more data or alternative architectures.

Conclusion: ELMM为多模态知识图谱补全建立了新范式，在保持高性能的同时大幅降低计算成本。

Abstract: Multimodal Knowledge Graphs (MKGs) extend traditional knowledge graphs by
incorporating visual and textual modalities, enabling richer and more
expressive entity representations. However, existing MKGs often suffer from
incompleteness, which hinder their effectiveness in downstream tasks.
Therefore, multimodal knowledge graph completion (MKGC) task is receiving
increasing attention. While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise for
knowledge graph completion (KGC), their application to the multimodal setting
remains underexplored. Moreover, applying Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) to the task of MKGC introduces significant challenges: (1) the large
number of image tokens per entity leads to semantic noise and modality
conflicts, and (2) the high computational cost of processing large token
inputs. To address these issues, we propose Efficient Lightweight Multimodal
Large Language Models (ELMM) for MKGC. ELMM proposes a Multi-view Visual Token
Compressor (MVTC) based on multi-head attention mechanism, which adaptively
compresses image tokens from both textual and visual views, thereby effectively
reducing redundancy while retaining necessary information and avoiding modality
conflicts. Additionally, we design an attention pruning strategy to remove
redundant attention layers from MLLMs, thereby significantly reducing the
inference cost. We further introduce a linear projection to compensate for the
performance degradation caused by pruning. Extensive experiments on benchmark
FB15k-237-IMG and WN18-IMG demonstrate that ELMM achieves state-of-the-art
performance while substantially improving computational efficiency,
establishing a new paradigm for multimodal knowledge graph completion.

TL;DR: ELLSA是首个全双工、端到端的多模态模型，能够同时感知和生成视觉、文本、语音和动作，实现更自然的人机交互。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类交互本质上是多模态和全双工的，需要模型能够同时感知和生成多种模态，实现更自然的人类行为模拟。

Method: 采用新颖的SA-MoE架构（自注意力专家混合），将各模态路由到专门的专家模块，通过统一的注意力主干进行融合。

Result: 在语音交互和机器人操作基准测试中，ELLSA与特定模态基线表现相当，同时支持高级多模态和全双工行为。

Conclusion: ELLSA代表了向更自然和通用交互智能迈出的一步，有助于实现人工通用智能的追求。

Abstract: Human interaction is inherently multimodal and full-duplex: we listen while
watching, speak while acting, and fluidly adapt to turn-taking and
interruptions. Realizing these capabilities is essential for building models
simulating humans. We present ELLSA (End-to-end Listen, Look, Speak and Act),
which, to our knowledge, is the first full-duplex, end-to-end model that
simultaneously perceives and generates across vision, text, speech, and action
within a single architecture, enabling interaction patterns previously out of
reach, yielding more natural, human-like behaviors. At its core is a novel
SA-MoE architecture (Self-Attention Mixture-of-Experts) that routes each
modality to specialized experts and fuses them through a unified attention
backbone. This provides a generalizable solution for joint multimodal
perception and concurrent generation, leveraging strong pre-trained components
while enabling efficient modality integration and mitigating modality
interference. On speech-interaction and robot-manipulation benchmarks, ELLSA
matches modality-specific baselines, while uniquely supporting advanced
multimodal and full-duplex behaviors such as dialogue and action turn-taking,
defective instruction rejection, speaking-while-acting, context-grounded visual
question answering, and action barge-ins. We contend that ELLSA represents a
step toward more natural and general interactive intelligence, contributing to
the broader pursuit of artificial general intelligence. All data, code and
model checkpoints will be released upon acceptance.

TL;DR: GraphVista是一个统一的框架，通过分层组织图信息和引入规划代理来解决视觉语言模型在图理解中的可扩展性和模态协调问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在图理解中面临输入令牌限制、可扩展性瓶颈以及缺乏有效协调文本和视觉模态的机制。

Method: GraphVista采用分层方法组织图信息到轻量级GraphRAG基础中，仅检索任务相关的文本描述和高分辨率视觉子图；引入规划代理将任务路由到最适合的模态。

Result: GraphVista可扩展到比现有基准大200倍的大型图，在质量上比最先进的基线方法提升4.4倍，持续优于现有的文本、视觉和融合方法。

Conclusion: GraphVista通过充分利用两种模态的互补优势，有效解决了图理解中的可扩展性和模态协调挑战。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown promise in graph understanding, but
remain limited by input-token constraints, facing scalability bottlenecks and
lacking effective mechanisms to coordinate textual and visual modalities. To
address these challenges, we propose GraphVista, a unified framework that
enhances both scalability and modality coordination in graph understanding. For
scalability, GraphVista organizes graph information hierarchically into a
lightweight GraphRAG base, which retrieves only task-relevant textual
descriptions and high-resolution visual subgraphs, compressing redundant
context while preserving key reasoning elements. For modality coordination,
GraphVista introduces a planning agent that routes tasks to the most suitable
modality-using the text modality for simple property reasoning and the visual
modality for local and structurally complex reasoning grounded in explicit
topology. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GraphVista scales to large
graphs, up to $200\times$ larger than those used in existing benchmarks, and
consistently outperforms existing textual, visual, and fusion-based methods,
achieving up to $4.4\times$ quality improvement over the state-of-the-art
baselines by fully exploiting the complementary strengths of both modalities.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出Domain-Contextualized Concept Graph (CDC)框架，将领域提升为概念表示的一等元素，采用C-D-C三元组结构，实现上下文感知推理和跨领域类比。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统知识图谱受限于固定本体论的刚性层次结构，根源在于将领域视为隐式上下文而非显式推理组件。

Method: 采用C-D-C三元组结构<概念, 关系@领域, 概念'>，基于认知语言同构映射原则，定义20+标准化关系谓词，并在Prolog中实现完整推理能力。

Result: 在教育、企业知识系统和文档管理等案例中，CDC实现了上下文感知推理、跨领域类比和个性化知识建模等传统框架无法实现的能力。

Conclusion: CDC框架通过将领域作为显式推理组件，克服了传统本体论的限制，为知识表示和推理提供了更灵活和认知对齐的方法。

Abstract: Traditional knowledge graphs are constrained by fixed ontologies that
organize concepts within rigid hierarchical structures. The root cause lies in
treating domains as implicit context rather than as explicit, reasoning-level
components. To overcome these limitations, we propose the Domain-Contextualized
Concept Graph (CDC), a novel knowledge modeling framework that elevates domains
to first-class elements of conceptual representation. CDC adopts a C-D-C triple
structure - <Concept, Relation@Domain, Concept'> - where domain specifications
serve as dynamic classification dimensions defined on demand. Grounded in a
cognitive-linguistic isomorphic mapping principle, CDC operationalizes how
humans understand concepts through contextual frames. We formalize more than
twenty standardized relation predicates (structural, logical, cross-domain, and
temporal) and implement CDC in Prolog for full inference capability. Case
studies in education, enterprise knowledge systems, and technical documentation
demonstrate that CDC enables context-aware reasoning, cross-domain analogy, and
personalized knowledge modeling - capabilities unattainable under traditional
ontology-based frameworks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于工作流的数据代理在特定数据任务上表现良好，但由于依赖预定义工作流，无法实现完全自主的数据科学。

Method: 提出基于课程学习的代理训练范式，模拟人类数据科学家的学习轨迹，使LLM能够在真实环境中逐步获取和整合多种能力。同时引入数据驱动的轨迹合成框架构建高质量训练数据。

Result: 实验表明，仅8B参数的DeepAnalyze在性能上超越了基于最先进专有LLM构建的先前工作流代理。

Conclusion: DeepAnalyze模型、代码和训练数据已开源，为自主数据科学的发展铺平了道路。

Abstract: Autonomous data science, from raw data sources to analyst-grade deep research
reports, has been a long-standing challenge, and is now becoming feasible with
the emergence of powerful large language models (LLMs). Recent workflow-based
data agents have shown promising results on specific data tasks but remain
fundamentally limited in achieving fully autonomous data science due to their
reliance on predefined workflows. In this paper, we introduce DeepAnalyze-8B,
the first agentic LLM designed for autonomous data science, capable of
automatically completing the end-toend pipeline from data sources to
analyst-grade deep research reports. To tackle high-complexity data science
tasks, we propose a curriculum-based agentic training paradigm that emulates
the learning trajectory of human data scientists, enabling LLMs to
progressively acquire and integrate multiple capabilities in real-world
environments. We also introduce a data-grounded trajectory synthesis framework
that constructs high-quality training data. Through agentic training,
DeepAnalyze learns to perform a broad spectrum of data tasks, ranging from data
question answering and specialized analytical tasks to open-ended data
research. Experiments demonstrate that, with only 8B parameters, DeepAnalyze
outperforms previous workflow-based agents built on most advanced proprietary
LLMs. The model, code, and training data of DeepAnalyze are open-sourced,
paving the way toward autonomous data science.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 训练VLM代理面临从文本状态到复杂视觉观察的转变，这引入了部分可观测性并需要强大的世界建模能力。研究旨在探索VLM代理是否能够通过显式视觉状态推理构建内部世界模型。

Method: 将代理推理过程架构化为部分可观测马尔可夫决策过程(POMDP)，将推理分解为状态估计和转移建模。设计了世界建模奖励提供密集监督，并引入双层广义优势估计(Bi-Level GAE)进行回合级信用分配。

Result: 30亿参数模型在五个多样化代理基准测试中达到0.82分，相比未训练模型(0.21)提升3倍，并优于GPT-5(0.75)、Gemini 2.5 Pro(0.67)和Claude 4.5(0.62)等专有推理模型。

Conclusion: 通过视觉状态推理，VLM代理能够有效构建内部世界模型。最优表示形式是任务依赖的：自然语言擅长捕捉语义关系，而结构化格式对于精确操作和控制至关重要。

Abstract: A key challenge in training Vision-Language Model (VLM) agents, compared to
Language Model (LLM) agents, lies in the shift from textual states to complex
visual observations. This transition introduces partial observability and
demands robust world modeling. We ask: Can VLM agents construct internal world
models through explicit visual state reasoning? To address this question, we
architecturally enforce and reward the agent's reasoning process via
reinforcement learning (RL), formulating it as a Partially Observable Markov
Decision Process (POMDP). We find that decomposing the agent's reasoning into
State Estimation ("what is the current state?") and Transition Modeling ("what
comes next?") is critical for success, as demonstrated through five reasoning
strategies. Our investigation into how agents represent internal beliefs
reveals that the optimal representation is task-dependent: Natural Language
excels at capturing semantic relationships in general tasks, while Structured
formats are indispensable for precise manipulation and control. Building on
these insights, we design a World Modeling Reward that provides dense,
turn-level supervision for accurate state prediction, and introduce Bi-Level
General Advantage Estimation (Bi-Level GAE) for turn-aware credit assignment.
Through this form of visual state reasoning, a 3B-parameter model achieves a
score of 0.82 across five diverse agent benchmarks, representing a 3$\times$
improvement over its untrained counterpart (0.21) and outperforming proprietary
reasoning models such as GPT-5 (0.75), Gemini 2.5 Pro (0.67) and Claude 4.5
(0.62). All experiments are conducted within our VAGEN framework, a scalable
system for training and analyzing multi-turn VLM agents in diverse visual
environments. Code and data are publicly available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的评估方法，用于测试用户能否从强化学习算法的解释中识别智能体的目标。在Ms. Pacman环境中测试了4种可解释强化学习算法，发现只有一种算法的准确率超过随机水平，且用户普遍高估自己的判断能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 可解释强化学习算法在调试方面有核心应用，但缺乏对其相对性能的比较评估。需要了解用户是否能从算法解释中准确识别智能体的目标。

Method: 使用Atari的Ms. Pacman环境和4种可解释强化学习算法，提出新颖的评估方法测试用户从决策解释中识别智能体目标的能力。

Result: 只有一种算法的准确率超过随机水平；用户普遍对自己的选择过度自信；用户自我报告的识别难易度和理解程度与实际准确率不相关。

Conclusion: 当前可解释强化学习算法的解释效果有限，用户的主观感受与实际识别能力存在偏差，需要改进算法解释的质量和评估方法。

Abstract: Debugging is a core application of explainable reinforcement learning (XRL)
algorithms; however, limited comparative evaluations have been conducted to
understand their relative performance. We propose a novel evaluation
methodology to test whether users can identify an agent's goal from an
explanation of its decision-making. Utilising the Atari's Ms. Pacman
environment and four XRL algorithms, we find that only one achieved greater
than random accuracy for the tested goals and that users were generally
overconfident in their selections. Further, we find that users' self-reported
ease of identification and understanding for every explanation did not
correlate with their accuracy.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于LLM的多智能体框架，用于自动化GPU内核优化，通过系统化探索设计空间，显著提升了内核性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GPU内核优化对AI发展至关重要，但现有方法难以处理内存层次、线程调度和硬件特性之间的复杂交互。传统LLM方法在单次生成或简单优化方面效果有限。

Method: 采用多智能体协作框架，包含基础指令、动态上下文管理和策略搜索，模拟专家工程师的工作流程，让LLM能够推理硬件权衡、整合性能分析反馈并进行迭代优化。

Result: 在KernelBench基准测试中，相比基线方法，该系统能产生正确解决方案（基线经常失败），并实现高达16倍的运行时性能提升。

Conclusion: 智能体LLM框架在实现完全自动化、可扩展的GPU内核优化方面具有巨大潜力。

Abstract: The efficiency of GPU kernels is central to the progress of modern AI, yet
optimizing them remains a difficult and labor-intensive task due to complex
interactions between memory hierarchies, thread scheduling, and
hardware-specific characteristics. While recent advances in large language
models (LLMs) provide new opportunities for automated code generation, existing
approaches largely treat LLMs as single-shot generators or naive refinement
tools, limiting their effectiveness in navigating the irregular kernel
optimization landscape. We introduce an LLM agentic framework for GPU kernel
optimization that systematically explores the design space through multi-agent
collaboration, grounded instruction, dynamic context management, and strategic
search. This framework mimics the workflow of expert engineers, enabling LLMs
to reason about hardware trade-offs, incorporate profiling feedback, and refine
kernels iteratively. We evaluate our approach on KernelBench, a benchmark for
LLM-based kernel optimization, and demonstrate substantial improvements over
baseline agents: our system produces correct solutions where baselines often
fail, and achieves kernels with up to 16x faster runtime performance. These
results highlight the potential of agentic LLM frameworks to advance fully
automated, scalable GPU kernel optimization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工具增强的大型语言模型在现实应用中越来越普遍，但工具使用错误仍然影响其可靠性，需要一种系统方法来检测和纠正这些错误。

Method: 定义8种特定工具调用错误类型，构建合成数据集训练ToolCritic，主LLM基于ToolCritic的反馈修正其响应。

Result: 在Schema-Guided Dialogue数据集上的实验显示，ToolCritic相比基线方法（包括零样本提示和自校正技术）将工具调用准确率提高了13%。

Conclusion: ToolCritic是实现更稳健的LLM与外部工具集成的有前景步骤，特别是在现实世界对话应用中。

Abstract: Tool-augmented large language models (LLMs) are increasingly employed in
real-world applications, but tool usage errors still hinder their reliability.
We introduce ToolCritic, a diagnostic framework that evaluates and improves LLM
behavior in multi-turn, tool-augmented dialogues. ToolCritic detects eight
distinct error types specific to tool-calling (e.g., premature invocation,
argument misalignment, and misinterpretation of tool outputs) and provides
targeted feedback to the main LLM. The main LLM, assumed to have strong
reasoning, task understanding and orchestration capabilities, then revises its
response based on ToolCritic's feedback. We systematically define these error
categories and construct a synthetic dataset to train ToolCritic. Experimental
results on the Schema-Guided Dialogue (SGD) dataset demonstrate that ToolCritic
improves tool-calling accuracy by up to 13% over baselines, including zero-shot
prompting and self-correction techniques. This represents a promising step
toward more robust LLM integration with external tools in real-world dialogue
applications.

Motivation: 传统基因集富集分析方法依赖精心策划的注释，在处理特征不明确的基因时表现不佳。大型语言模型虽然提供了替代方案，但难以在结构化本体中表示复杂的生物学知识。

Method: 开发了BRAINCELL-AID多代理AI系统，整合自由文本描述和本体标签，采用检索增强生成技术，通过PubMed文献精炼预测，减少幻觉并提高可解释性。

Result: 在小鼠基因集的顶级预测中实现了77%的正确注释率，成功注释了BRAIN Initiative Cell Census Network生成的5,322个脑细胞簇，识别了区域特异性基因共表达模式，并推断出基因集合的功能作用。

Conclusion: BRAINCELL-AID创建了一个有价值的资源，支持社区驱动的细胞类型注释，特别是在识别基底神经节相关细胞类型方面提供了神经学上有意义的描述。

Abstract: Single-cell RNA sequencing has transformed our ability to identify diverse
cell types and their transcriptomic signatures. However, annotating these
signatures-especially those involving poorly characterized genes-remains a
major challenge. Traditional methods, such as Gene Set Enrichment Analysis
(GSEA), depend on well-curated annotations and often perform poorly in these
contexts. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising alternative but
struggle to represent complex biological knowledge within structured
ontologies. To address this, we present BRAINCELL-AID (BRAINCELL-AID:
https://biodataai.uth.edu/BRAINCELL-AID), a novel multi-agent AI system that
integrates free-text descriptions with ontology labels to enable more accurate
and robust gene set annotation. By incorporating retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG), we developed a robust agentic workflow that refines predictions using
relevant PubMed literature, reducing hallucinations and enhancing
interpretability. Using this workflow, we achieved correct annotations for 77%
of mouse gene sets among their top predictions. Applying this approach, we
annotated 5,322 brain cell clusters from the comprehensive mouse brain cell
atlas generated by the BRAIN Initiative Cell Census Network, enabling novel
insights into brain cell function by identifying region-specific gene
co-expression patterns and inferring functional roles of gene ensembles.
BRAINCELL-AID also identifies Basal Ganglia-related cell types with
neurologically meaningful descriptions. Hence, we create a valuable resource to
support community-driven cell type annotation.

Result: 相比人工专家报告，两个系统都实现了显著生产力提升(NAS:11.55秒/案例；KPD-MADS:91.97秒；人工基准:1920秒)。KPD-MADS在解释充分性、实际适用性和可用性方面获得更高评分。

Conclusion: 结构化多代理交互可以增强金融AI中的推理严谨性和可解释性，推动企业信用评估中可扩展且可辩护的自动化进程。

Abstract: Despite advances in financial AI, the automation of evidence-based reasoning
remains unresolved in corporate credit assessment, where qualitative
non-financial indicators exert decisive influence on loan repayment outcomes
yet resist formalization. Existing approaches focus predominantly on numerical
prediction and provide limited support for the interpretive judgments required
in professional loan evaluation. This study develops and evaluates two
operational large language model (LLM)-based systems designed to generate
structured reasoning from non-financial evidence. The first is a
non-adversarial single-agent system (NAS) that produces bidirectional analysis
through a single-pass reasoning pipeline. The second is a debate-based
multi-agent system (KPD-MADS) that operationalizes adversarial verification
through a ten-step structured interaction protocol grounded in Karl Popper's
critical dialogue framework. Both systems were applied to three real corporate
cases and evaluated by experienced credit risk professionals. Compared to
manual expert reporting, both systems achieved substantial productivity gains
(NAS: 11.55 s per case; KPD-MADS: 91.97 s; human baseline: 1920 s). The
KPD-MADS demonstrated superior reasoning quality, receiving higher median
ratings in explanatory adequacy (4.0 vs. 3.0), practical applicability (4.0 vs.
3.0), and usability (62.5 vs. 52.5). These findings show that structured
multi-agent interaction can enhance reasoning rigor and interpretability in
financial AI, advancing scalable and defensible automation in corporate credit
assessment.

Motivation: 传统感官评估鱼类新鲜度存在主观性、不一致性和难以标准化的问题，需要开发客观、可靠的自动化评估方法。

Method: 从鱼眼图像中系统提取颜色统计、多色彩空间直方图、LBP和GLCM等纹理特征，融合全局色度变化和局部退化特征，使用LightGBM和ANN进行分类。

Result: 在标准训练测试设置下，LightGBM达到77.56%准确率，比之前深度学习基线提升14.35%；使用增强数据后，ANN达到97.16%准确率，比之前最佳结果提升19.86%。

Conclusion: 精心设计的手工特征经过策略性处理后，能够为自动化鱼类新鲜度评估提供鲁棒、可解释且可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate assessment of fish freshness remains a major challenge in the food
industry, with direct consequences for product quality, market value, and
consumer health. Conventional sensory evaluation is inherently subjective,
inconsistent, and difficult to standardize across contexts, often limited by
subtle, species-dependent spoilage cues. To address these limitations, we
propose a handcrafted feature-based approach that systematically extracts and
incrementally fuses complementary descriptors, including color statistics,
histograms across multiple color spaces, and texture features such as Local
Binary Patterns (LBP) and Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrices (GLCM), from fish
eye images. Our method captures global chromatic variations from full images
and localized degradations from ROI segments, fusing each independently to
evaluate their effectiveness in assessing freshness. Experiments on the
Freshness of the Fish Eyes (FFE) dataset demonstrate the approach's
effectiveness: in a standard train-test setting, a LightGBM classifier achieved
77.56% accuracy, a 14.35% improvement over the previous deep learning baseline
of 63.21%. With augmented data, an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) reached
97.16% accuracy, surpassing the prior best of 77.3% by 19.86%. These results
demonstrate that carefully engineered, handcrafted features, when strategically
processed, yield a robust, interpretable, and reliable solution for automated
fish freshness assessment, providing valuable insights for practical
applications in food quality monitoring.

Motivation: 传统基于规则的方法可解释性强但缺乏适应性，深度学习方法预测能力强但缺乏透明度和物理合理性，现有LLM方法忽视了HVAC运行的物理原理。

Method: 开发了物理信息反射和交叉算子，嵌入热力学和控制理论约束，在进化循环中自动生成和优化异常检测规则。

Result: 在公共建筑故障检测数据集上实现了最先进的性能，同时生成可解释和可操作的诊断规则。

Conclusion: PILLM框架推进了智能建筑系统中可信赖和可部署AI的发展，实现了自适应且物理基础的异常检测。

Abstract: Heating, Ventilation, and Air-Conditioning (HVAC) systems account for a
substantial share of global building energy use, making reliable anomaly
detection essential for improving efficiency and reducing emissions. Classical
rule-based approaches offer explainability but lack adaptability, while deep
learning methods provide predictive power at the cost of transparency,
efficiency, and physical plausibility. Recent attempts to use Large Language
Models (LLMs) for anomaly detection improve interpretability but largely ignore
the physical principles that govern HVAC operations. We present PILLM, a
Physics-Informed LLM framework that operates within an evolutionary loop to
automatically generate, evaluate, and refine anomaly detection rules. Our
approach introduces physics-informed reflection and crossover operators that
embed thermodynamic and control-theoretic constraints, enabling rules that are
both adaptive and physically grounded. Experiments on the public Building Fault
Detection dataset show that PILLM achieves state-of-the-art performance while
producing diagnostic rules that are interpretable and actionable, advancing
trustworthy and deployable AI for smart building systems.

Conclusion: 通信协议选择对多智能体系统性能至关重要，ProtocolBench提供了标准化评估方法，ProtocolRouter通过动态协议选择能显著提升系统可靠性和性能。

Abstract: As large-scale multi-agent systems evolve, the communication protocol layer
has become a critical yet under-evaluated factor shaping performance and
reliability. Despite the existence of diverse protocols (A2A, ACP, ANP, Agora,
etc.), selection is often intuition-driven and lacks standardized guidance. We
introduce ProtocolBench, a benchmark that systematically compares agent
protocols along four measurable axes: task success, end-to-end latency, message
or byte overhead, and robustness under failures. On ProtocolBench, protocol
choice significantly influences system behavior. In the Streaming Queue
scenario, overall completion time varies by up to 36.5% across protocols, and
mean end-to-end latency differs by 3.48 s. Under Fail-Storm Recovery,
resilience also differs consistently across protocols. Beyond evaluation, we
present ProtocolRouter, a learnable protocol router that selects per-scenario
(or per-module) protocols from requirement and runtime signals. ProtocolRouter
reduces Fail-Storm recovery time by up to 18.1% versus the best single-protocol
baseline, and achieves scenario-specific gains such as higher success in GAIA.
We also release ProtocolRouterBench to standardize protocol evaluation and
improve reliability at scale.

### [55] [Combining ECG Foundation Model and XGBoost to Predict In-Hospital Malignant Ventricular Arrhythmias in AMI Patients](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17172)
*Shun Huang,Wenlu Xing,Shijia Geng,Hailong Wang,Guangkun Nie,Gongzheng Tang,Chenyang He,Shenda Hong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本研究开发了一种结合ECG基础模型和XGBoost分类器的混合预测框架，用于预测急性心肌梗死后的恶性室性心律失常风险，在提高准确性的同时保持可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 急性心肌梗死后恶性室性心律失常是院内死亡的主要原因，但早期识别仍是临床挑战。传统风险评分性能有限，而端到端深度学习模型缺乏临床信任所需的可解释性。

Method: 使用ECG基础模型(ECGFounder)提取150维诊断概率特征，通过特征选择后训练XGBoost分类器，并采用SHAP方法进行可解释性分析。

Result: 混合模型AUC达到0.801，优于KNN(0.677)、RNN(0.676)和1D-CNN(0.720)。SHAP分析显示模型识别的关键特征与临床知识高度一致。

Conclusion: 该混合框架为VT/VF风险预测提供了新范式，验证了基础模型输出作为有效自动化特征工程用于构建可信赖、可解释的AI临床决策支持系统。

Abstract: Malignant ventricular arrhythmias (VT/VF) following acute myocardial
infarction (AMI) are a major cause of in-hospital death, yet early
identification remains a clinical challenge. While traditional risk scores have
limited performance, end-to-end deep learning models often lack the
interpretability needed for clinical trust. This study aimed to develop a
hybrid predictive framework that integrates a large-scale electrocardiogram
(ECG) foundation model (ECGFounder) with an interpretable XGBoost classifier to
improve both accuracy and interpretability. We analyzed 6,634 ECG recordings
from AMI patients, among whom 175 experienced in-hospital VT/VF. The ECGFounder
model was used to extract 150-dimensional diagnostic probability features ,
which were then refined through feature selection to train the XGBoost
classifier. Model performance was evaluated using AUC and F1-score , and the
SHAP method was used for interpretability. The ECGFounder + XGBoost hybrid
model achieved an AUC of 0.801 , outperforming KNN (AUC 0.677), RNN (AUC
0.676), and an end-to-end 1D-CNN (AUC 0.720). SHAP analysis revealed that
model-identified key features, such as "premature ventricular complexes" (risk
predictor) and "normal sinus rhythm" (protective factor), were highly
consistent with clinical knowledge. We conclude that this hybrid framework
provides a novel paradigm for VT/VF risk prediction by validating the use of
foundation model outputs as effective, automated feature engineering for
building trustworthy, explainable AI-based clinical decision support systems.

*Melik Ozolcer,Sang Won Bae*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究了一个基于网页部署、工具增强的LLM健康教练系统，通过真实用户实验发现，统一的工具密集型策略虽然能提升平均价值，但对特定用户群体（特别是健康素养低但自我效能高的用户）产生负面影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何通过离线策略评估和轻量级模拟器来实现个性化健康教练服务，避免平均指标掩盖的亚群体损害。

Method: 使用7名用户的280个评分轮次进行离线策略评估，分析因子化决策头（工具/风格），并通过带有隐藏原型的轻量级模拟器测试早期信息增益奖励的效果。

Result: 统一的重工具策略会损害特定用户群体；在模拟器中添加小的早期信息增益奖励可可靠地缩短特征识别时间，提高目标成功率和pass@3指标。

Conclusion: 提出了以评估为先的个性化路径：冻结生成器，在类型化奖励上学习亚群体感知的决策头，并始终报告每个原型的指标以揭示平均指标掩盖的亚群体损害。

Abstract: We study a web-deployed, tool-augmented LLM health coach with real users. In
a pilot with seven users (280 rated turns), offline policy evaluation (OPE)
over factorized decision heads (Tool/Style) shows that a uniform heavy-tool
policy raises average value on logs but harms specific subgroups, most notably
low-health-literacy/high-self-efficacy users. A lightweight simulator with
hidden archetypes further shows that adding a small early information-gain
bonus reliably shortens trait identification and improves goal success and
pass@3. Together, these early findings indicate an evaluation-first path to
personalization: freeze the generator, learn subgroup-aware decision heads on
typed rewards (objective tool outcomes and satisfaction), and always report
per-archetype metrics to surface subgroup harms that averages obscure.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 疾病进展建模面临挑战：需要基于不规则时间事件样本学习连续时间动态，且患者存在异质性（不同进展速率和路径）。现有方法要么缺乏从真实数据学习的适应性，要么无法捕捉复杂的连续时间动态。

Method: TD-HNODE模型将疾病进展表示为时间详细超图，通过神经ODE框架学习连续时间进展动态。包含可学习的TD-Hypergraph Laplacian，捕捉进展轨迹内和轨迹间疾病并发症标志物的相互依赖关系。

Result: 在两个真实世界临床数据集上的实验表明，TD-HNODE在建模2型糖尿病和相关心血管疾病进展方面优于多个基线方法。

Conclusion: TD-HNODE通过结合时间详细超图和神经ODE框架，能够有效建模复杂的疾病进展动态，解决了现有方法在适应性和连续时间动态捕捉方面的局限性。

Abstract: Disease progression modeling aims to characterize and predict how a patient's
disease complications worsen over time based on longitudinal electronic health
records (EHRs). Accurate modeling of disease progression, such as type 2
diabetes, can enhance patient sub-phenotyping and inform effective and timely
interventions. However, the problem is challenging due to the need to learn
continuous-time dynamics of progression patterns based on irregular-time event
samples and patient heterogeneity (\eg different progression rates and
pathways). Existing mechanistic and data-driven methods either lack
adaptability to learn from real-world data or fail to capture complex
continuous-time dynamics on progression trajectories. To address these
limitations, we propose Temporally Detailed Hypergraph Neural Ordinary
Differential Equation (TD-HNODE), which represents disease progression on
clinically recognized trajectories as a temporally detailed hypergraph and
learns the continuous-time progression dynamics via a neural ODE framework.
TD-HNODE contains a learnable TD-Hypergraph Laplacian that captures the
interdependency of disease complication markers within both intra- and
inter-progression trajectories. Experiments on two real-world clinical datasets
demonstrate that TD-HNODE outperforms multiple baselines in modeling the
progression of type 2 diabetes and related cardiovascular diseases.

Abstract: The cryptocurrency market offers significant investment opportunities but
faces challenges including high volatility and fragmented information. Data
integration and analysis are essential for informed investment decisions.
Currently, investors use three main approaches: (1) Manual analysis across
various sources, which depends heavily on individual experience and is
time-consuming and prone to bias; (2) Data aggregation platforms-limited in
functionality and depth of analysis; (3) Large language model agents-based on
static pretrained models, lacking real-time data integration and multi-step
reasoning capabilities. To address these limitations, we present Coinvisor, a
reinforcement learning-based chatbot that provides comprehensive analytical
support for cryptocurrency investment through a multi-agent framework.
Coinvisor integrates diverse analytical capabilities through specialized tools.
Its key innovation is a reinforcement learning-based tool selection mechanism
that enables multi-step planning and flexible integration of diverse data
sources. This design supports real-time interaction and adaptive analysis of
dynamic content, delivering accurate and actionable investment insights. We
evaluated Coinvisor through automated benchmarks on tool calling accuracy and

that Coinvisor improves recall by 40.7% and F1 score by 26.6% over the base
model in tool orchestration. User studies show high satisfaction (4.64/5), with
participants preferring Coinvisor to both general LLMs and existing crypto
platforms (4.62/5).

TL;DR: 提出LaGAT框架，将基于图注意力的神经MAPF策略MAGAT集成到搜索算法LaCAM中，在密集多智能体路径规划场景中优于纯搜索和纯学习方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决密集多智能体路径规划问题中实时寻找近似最优解的挑战，现有学习引导搜索方法表现不佳

Method: 改进MAGAT架构，采用预训练-微调策略，集成死锁检测机制来处理不完美的神经引导

Result: LaGAT在密集场景中优于纯搜索和纯学习方法

Conclusion: 精心设计的混合搜索为紧密耦合的挑战性多智能体协调问题提供了强大解决方案

Abstract: Finding near-optimal solutions for dense multi-agent pathfinding (MAPF)
problems in real-time remains challenging even for state-of-the-art planners.
To this end, we develop a hybrid framework that integrates a learned heuristic
derived from MAGAT, a neural MAPF policy with a graph attention scheme, into a
leading search-based algorithm, LaCAM. While prior work has explored
learning-guided search in MAPF, such methods have historically underperformed.
In contrast, our approach, termed LaGAT, outperforms both purely search-based
and purely learning-based methods in dense scenarios. This is achieved through
an enhanced MAGAT architecture, a pre-train-then-fine-tune strategy on maps of
interest, and a deadlock detection scheme to account for imperfect neural
guidance. Our results demonstrate that, when carefully designed, hybrid search
offers a powerful solution for tightly coupled, challenging multi-agent
coordination problems.

TL;DR: 提出了FBI_LTL，一种用于基于仿真的规划问题的多样化规划器，使用线性时序逻辑定义语义多样性标准，生成语义多样化的计划。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有规划器只生成单一计划，可能无法满足代理偏好；现有多样化规划方法可能产生语法不同但语义相同的解决方案。

Method: 利用线性时序逻辑定义语义多样性标准，并将这些基于LTL的多样性模型直接集成到搜索过程中。

Result: 在各种基准测试上的广泛评估表明，FBI_LTL相比基线方法能生成更多样化的计划。

Conclusion: 这项工作确立了在基于仿真的环境中进行语义引导多样化规划的可行性，为在传统基于模型方法失败的现实非符号领域中的创新方法铺平了道路。

Abstract: Autonomous agents rely on automated planning algorithms to achieve their
objectives. Simulation-based planning offers a significant advantage over
declarative models in modelling complex environments. However, relying solely
on a planner that produces a single plan may not be practical, as the generated
plans may not always satisfy the agent's preferences. To address this
limitation, we introduce $\texttt{FBI}_\texttt{LTL}$, a diverse planner
explicitly designed for simulation-based planning problems.
$\texttt{FBI}_\texttt{LTL}$ utilises Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) to define
semantic diversity criteria, enabling agents to specify what constitutes
meaningfully different plans. By integrating these LTL-based diversity models
directly into the search process, $\texttt{FBI}_\texttt{LTL}$ ensures the
generation of semantically diverse plans, addressing a critical limitation of
existing diverse planning approaches that may produce syntactically different
but semantically identical solutions. Extensive evaluations on various
benchmarks consistently demonstrate that $\texttt{FBI}_\texttt{LTL}$ generates
more diverse plans compared to a baseline approach. This work establishes the
feasibility of semantically-guided diverse planning in simulation-based
environments, paving the way for innovative approaches in realistic,
non-symbolic domains where traditional model-based approaches fail.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了在地理区域内维持共同的作战态势图，需要开发能够自主控制智能代理的方法，以侦察地理区域并平衡搜索和跟踪目标对象的需求。

Method: 使用Dempster-Shafer理论和高斯传感器模型构建生成模型，采用贝叶斯方法更新后验概率分布，计算变分自由能量来指导代理向最小化自由能量的位置移动。

Result: 该方法在仿真中成功指导代理移动，能够有效平衡探索广阔地理区域和跟踪已识别目标对象之间的权衡。

Conclusion: 基于主动推理的路径规划方法为解决探索与利用的挑战提供了一种有效解决方案，使代理能够在维持态势图的同时优化侦察行为。

Abstract: We develop an active inference route-planning method for the autonomous
control of intelligent agents. The aim is to reconnoiter a geographical area to
maintain a common operational picture. To achieve this, we construct an
evidence map that reflects our current understanding of the situation,
incorporating both positive and "negative" sensor observations of possible
target objects collected over time, and diffusing the evidence across the map
as time progresses. The generative model of active inference uses
Dempster-Shafer theory and a Gaussian sensor model, which provides input to the
agent. The generative process employs a Bayesian approach to update a posterior
probability distribution. We calculate the variational free energy for all
positions within the area by assessing the divergence between a pignistic
probability distribution of the evidence map and a posterior probability
distribution of a target object based on the observations, including the level
of surprise associated with receiving new observations. Using the free energy,
we direct the agents' movements in a simulation by taking an incremental step
toward a position that minimizes the free energy. This approach addresses the
challenge of exploration and exploitation, allowing agents to balance searching
extensive areas of the geographical map while tracking identified target
objects.

TL;DR: 法律机器学习中标签不确定性问题：法律判决结果常受人为干预影响，导致标签不确定性，这会显著影响模型行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 法律领域机器学习通常将过去案件结果视为真实标签，但实际法律结果常受和解、上诉等程序性干预影响，导致标签不确定性。

Method: 在欧洲人权法院案件分类背景下，分析不同标签构建方式如何影响模型行为，使用标签估算方法处理不确定性。

Result: 研究表明，训练过程中标签的构建方式会显著影响模型行为，标签不确定性是AI与法律领域的重要关注点。

Conclusion: 法律机器学习应用需要考虑标签不确定性，虽然存在估算方法，但都基于无法验证的假设，标签不确定性会塑造模型行为。

Abstract: Machine learning is increasingly used in the legal domain, where it typically
operates retrospectively by treating past case outcomes as ground truth.
However, legal outcomes are often shaped by human interventions that are not
captured in most machine learning approaches. A final decision may result from
a settlement, an appeal, or other procedural actions. This creates label
indeterminacy: the outcome could have been different if the intervention had or
had not taken place. We argue that legal machine learning applications need to
account for label indeterminacy. Methods exist that can impute these
indeterminate labels, but they are all grounded in unverifiable assumptions. In
the context of classifying cases from the European Court of Human Rights, we
show that the way that labels are constructed during training can significantly
affect model behaviour. We therefore position label indeterminacy as a relevant
concern in AI & Law and demonstrate how it can shape model behaviour.

TL;DR: MIRAGE是一个推理时的多模态虚假信息检测框架，通过分解验证过程为四个模块：视觉真实性评估、跨模态一致性分析、检索增强的事实核查和校准判断模块，在MMFakeBench上达到81.65% F1分数，优于最强零样本基线7.65个百分点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 网络平台上的多模态虚假信息传播速度远超人工核查能力，现有监督检测模型需要领域特定训练数据且难以泛化到不同的操纵策略。

Method: 将多模态验证分解为四个顺序模块：视觉真实性评估检测AI生成图像，跨模态一致性分析识别上下文不当使用，检索增强事实核查通过迭代问题生成将声明与网络证据关联，校准判断模块整合所有信号。

Result: 在MMFakeBench验证集上，MIRAGE使用GPT-4o-mini达到81.65% F1和75.1%准确率，假阳性率34.3%，优于GPT-4V与MMD-Agent基线（74.0% F1，97.3%假阳性率）。测试集结果确认泛化能力。

Conclusion: 分解的智能推理与网络检索可以在无需领域特定训练的情况下匹配监督检测器性能，为标记数据稀缺的多模态虚假信息检测提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Misinformation spreads across web platforms through billions of daily
multimodal posts that combine text and images, overwhelming manual
fact-checking capacity. Supervised detection models require domain-specific
training data and fail to generalize across diverse manipulation tactics. We
present MIRAGE, an inference-time, model-pluggable agentic framework that
decomposes multimodal verification into four sequential modules: visual
veracity assessment detects AI-generated images, cross-modal consistency
analysis identifies out-of-context repurposing, retrieval-augmented factual
checking grounds claims in web evidence through iterative question generation,
and a calibrated judgment module integrates all signals. MIRAGE orchestrates
vision-language model reasoning with targeted web retrieval, outputs structured
and citation-linked rationales. On MMFakeBench validation set (1,000 samples),
MIRAGE with GPT-4o-mini achieves 81.65% F1 and 75.1% accuracy, outperforming
the strongest zero-shot baseline (GPT-4V with MMD-Agent at 74.0% F1) by 7.65
points while maintaining 34.3% false positive rate versus 97.3% for a
judge-only baseline. Test set results (5,000 samples) confirm generalization
with 81.44% F1 and 75.08% accuracy. Ablation studies show visual verification
contributes 5.18 F1 points and retrieval-augmented reasoning contributes 2.97
points. Our results demonstrate that decomposed agentic reasoning with web
retrieval can match supervised detector performance without domain-specific
training, enabling misinformation detection across modalities where labeled
data remains scarce.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 代码生成不仅需要准确的token预测，更需要理解解决方案层面的结构关系。大型语言模型具有推理能力，但部署成本高，因此需要将这种能力蒸馏到更小的模型中。

Method: 通过结构感知损失优化方法，训练小模型模拟大型语言模型的推理和问题解决能力，学习识别正确解决方案路径，建立问题定义与解决方案之间的结构对应关系。

Conclusion: 通过简单廉价的方法，成功将大型语言模型的推理能力蒸馏到更小的模型中，实现了高效且高质量的代码生成。

Abstract: Effective code generation with language models hinges on two critical
factors: accurately understanding the intent of the prompt and generating code
that applies algorithmic reasoning to produce correct solutions capable of
passing diverse test cases while adhering to the syntax of the target
programming language. Unlike other language tasks, code generation requires
more than accurate token prediction; it demands comprehension of solution-level
and structural relationships rather than merely generating the most likely
tokens. very large language model (VLLM) are capable of generating detailed
steps toward the correct solution of complex tasks where reasoning is crucial
in solving the problem. Such reasoning capabilities may be absent in smaller
language models. Therefore, in this work, we distill the reasoning capabilities
of a VLLM into a smaller, more efficient model that is faster and cheaper to
deploy. Our approach trains the model to emulate the reasoning and
problem-solving abilities of the VLLM by learning to identify correct solution
pathways and establishing a structural correspondence between problem
definitions and potential solutions through a novel method of structure-aware
loss optimization. This enables the model to transcend token-level generation
and to deeply grasp the overarching structure of solutions for given problems.
Experimental results show that our fine-tuned model, developed through a cheap
and simple to implement process, significantly outperforms our baseline model
in terms of pass@1, average data flow, and average syntax match metrics across
the MBPP, MBPP Plus, and HumanEval benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床医生需要实时工作并能解释其选择的排序系统。需要开发低延迟、基于解码器的重排序器。

Method: 采用单解码器方法，结合池化首词评分信号和不确定性门控解释步骤。模型在一次处理中评分所有候选，仅在列表真正模糊时生成简短的结构化理由。使用专注于困难案例的课程训练。

Result: 在遭遇范围订单选择任务上表现优异：快速路径Recall@1约0.45，nDCG@20约0.625；当门控激活时性能进一步提升（Recall@1约0.56，nDCG@20约0.699，门控率45%）。紧凑骨干网络在相同策略下也显示类似增益。

Conclusion: OG-Rank提供了一个实用方案：默认快速排序，在有助于时进行解释。这种模式适用于选择性生成能以可接受成本换取准确性的决策任务。单策略设计简化了部署和预算规划，课程原则（在困难案例上投入更多，简单案例上投入较少）可广泛应用于临床订单选择之外。

Abstract: Clinicians need ranking systems that work in real time and still justify
their choices. Motivated by the need for a low-latency, decoder-based reranker,
we present OG-Rank, a single-decoder approach that pairs a pooled first-token
scoring signal with an uncertainty-gated explanation step. The model scores all
candidates in one pass and generates a brief, structured rationale only when
the list is genuinely ambiguous, keeping latency predictable. Trained with a
curriculum that concentrates effort on hard cases, OG-Rank delivers strong
effectiveness on encounter-scoped order selection (fast path: Recall@1~0.45,
nDCG@20~0.625) and improves further when the gate activates (Recall@1~0.56,
nDCG@20~0.699 at a 45\% gate rate), while compact backbones show similar gains
under the same policy. Encoder baselines trail in both effectiveness and
flexibility. The result is a practical recipe: rank fast by default and explain
when it helps, a pattern that applies broadly to decision tasks where selective
generation buys accuracy at acceptable cost. The single-policy design
simplifies deployment and budget planning, and the curriculum principle (spend
more on the hard cases, less on the easy ones) readily transfers beyond
clinical order selection.

Abstract: Forecasting is not only a fundamental intellectual pursuit but also is of
significant importance to societal systems such as finance and economics. With
the rapid advances of large language models (LLMs) trained on Internet-scale
data, it raises the promise of employing LLMs to forecast real-world future
events, an emerging paradigm we call "LLM-as-a-Prophet". This paper
systematically investigates such predictive intelligence of LLMs. To this end,
we build Prophet Arena, a general evaluation benchmark that continuously
collects live forecasting tasks and decomposes each task into distinct pipeline
stages, in order to support our controlled and large-scale experimentation. Our
comprehensive evaluation reveals that many LLMs already exhibit impressive
forecasting capabilities, reflected in, e.g., their small calibration errors,
consistent prediction confidence and promising market returns. However, we also
uncover key bottlenecks towards achieving superior predictive intelligence via
LLM-as-a-Prophet, such as LLMs' inaccurate event recalls, misunderstanding of
data sources and slower information aggregation compared to markets when

Abstract: Steering cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) towards
desired outcomes is challenging, particularly when the global guidance from a
human on the whole multi-agent system is impractical in a large-scale MARL. On
the other hand, designing mechanisms to coordinate agents most relies on
empirical studies, lacking a easy-to-use research tool. In this work, we employ
multi-agent influence diagrams (MAIDs) as a graphical framework to address the
above issues. First, we introduce interaction paradigms that leverage MAIDs to
analyze and visualize existing approaches in MARL. Then, we design a new
interaction paradigm based on MAIDs, referred to as targeted intervention that
is applied to only a single targeted agent, so the problem of global guidance
can be mitigated. In our implementation, we introduce a causal inference
technique-referred to as Pre-Strategy Intervention (PSI)-to realize the
targeted intervention paradigm. Since MAIDs can be regarded as a special class
of causal diagrams, a composite desired outcome that integrates the primary
task goal and an additional desired outcome can be achieved by maximizing the
corresponding causal effect through the PSI. Moreover, the bundled relevance
graph analysis of MAIDs provides a tool to identify whether an MARL learning
paradigm is workable under the design of an interaction paradigm. In
experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed targeted
intervention, and verify the result of relevance graph analysis.

TL;DR: 提出Contextual Attention Modulation (CAM)机制和HyCAM框架，通过动态调节自注意力模块表示来增强任务特定特征同时保留通用知识，在多任务适应中显著优于现有方法。

Motivation: 大语言模型在多任务适应中存在知识保留与任务专业化之间的平衡问题，传统微调方法存在灾难性遗忘和资源消耗大的缺陷，现有参数高效方法在复杂多任务场景下表现不佳。

Method: 提出CAM机制动态调节自注意力模块表示，并构建HyCAM框架，结合共享的全参数CAM模块和多个轻量级专用CAM模块，采用动态路由策略进行自适应知识融合。

Result: 在问答、代码生成和逻辑推理等异构任务上的广泛实验表明，该方法显著优于现有方法，平均性能提升3.65%。

Conclusion: CAM和HyCAM框架有效解决了LLMs在多任务适应中的平衡问题，实现了更高效和有效的适应，同时保持了良好的知识保留能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) possess remarkable generalization capabilities
but struggle with multi-task adaptation, particularly in balancing knowledge
retention with task-specific specialization. Conventional fine-tuning methods
suffer from catastrophic forgetting and substantial resource consumption, while
existing parameter-efficient methods perform suboptimally in complex multi-task
scenarios. To address this, we propose Contextual Attention Modulation (CAM), a
novel mechanism that dynamically modulates the representations of
self-attention modules in LLMs. CAM enhances task-specific features while
preserving general knowledge, thereby facilitating more effective and efficient
adaptation. For effective multi-task adaptation, CAM is integrated into our
Hybrid Contextual Attention Modulation (HyCAM) framework, which combines a
shared, full-parameter CAM module with multiple specialized, lightweight CAM
modules, enhanced by a dynamic routing strategy for adaptive knowledge fusion.
Extensive experiments on heterogeneous tasks, including question answering,
code generation, and logical reasoning, demonstrate that our approach
significantly outperforms existing approaches, achieving an average performance
improvement of 3.65%. The implemented code and data are available to ease
reproducibility at https://github.com/Applied-Machine-Learning-Lab/HyCAM.

TL;DR: 研究发现视觉语言模型虽然能感知视觉证据，但在推理时未能有效利用这些证据，导致"看见但不相信"现象。通过基于注意力的推理时干预可显著提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究视觉语言模型在视觉问答任务中失败的原因：是由于未能感知视觉证据，还是未能有效利用已感知的证据。

Method: 通过分析层间注意力动态，发现浅层主要关注文本，深层稀疏但可靠地关注局部证据区域。提出基于选择性注意力掩码的推理时干预方法，无需训练。

Result: VLMs在输出错误答案时往往已感知到视觉证据。干预方法在LLaVA、Qwen、Gemma和InternVL等多个模型家族中一致提升准确率。

Conclusion: VLMs内部编码了可靠的证据但利用不足，通过显式化这些信号可以弥合感知与推理之间的差距，提升模型可靠性和诊断理解。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) achieve strong results on multimodal tasks such
as visual question answering, yet they can still fail even when the correct
visual evidence is present. In this work, we systematically investigate whether
these failures arise from not perceiving the evidence or from not leveraging it
effectively. By examining layer-wise attention dynamics, we find that shallow
layers focus primarily on text, while deeper layers sparsely but reliably
attend to localized evidence regions. Surprisingly, VLMs often perceive the
visual evidence when outputting incorrect answers, a phenomenon we term
``seeing but not believing'' that widely exists in major VLM families. Building
on this, we introduce an inference-time intervention that highlights deep-layer
evidence regions through selective attention-based masking. It requires no
training and consistently improves accuracy across multiple families, including
LLaVA, Qwen, Gemma, and InternVL. These results show that VLMs encode reliable
evidence internally but under-utilize it, making such signals explicit can
bridge the gap between perception and reasoning, advancing the diagnostic
understanding and reliability of VLMs.
