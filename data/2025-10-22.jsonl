Existing transfer methods attempt to bridge this gap by aligning the\nstatic weight spaces of models, a brittle and indirect approach that relies on\ntenuous correlations between parameter geometries. This paper introduces a\nfundamentally different and more direct paradigm: the Cartridge Activation\nSpace Transfer (CAST), a novel framework that liberates LoRA-encoded behaviors\nby learning a direct, nonlinear mapping between the activation manifolds, the\ngeometric structures formed by the model's internal neuron activations, of two\ndistinct LLM architectures. CAST treats a pre-trained LoRA as a frozen\n\"behavioral kernel.\" It learns a set of lightweight, bidirectional projection\nheads that translate the target model's activation stream into the source\nmodel's latent space, apply the frozen kernel, and project the result back.\nThis process, trained on a general text corpus without any task-specific data,\neffectively decouples the learned skill from the source architecture. We\ndemonstrate that CAST enables true \"zero-shot\" translation of any standard LoRA\nadapter. Our experiments, including transfers between heterogeneous model\nfamilies like Llama-2 and Mistral, show that CAST-translated adapters achieve\n85-95\\% of the performance of a LoRA fully retrained on the target model,\nquantitatively outperforming current weight-space transfer techniques and\nestablishing a new state-of-the-art in model interoperability."}

However, most advances\nin rainfall-runoff prediction have been evaluated under ideal data conditions,\nemphasizing accuracy rather than operational resilience. Here, we develop an\noperationally ready emulator of the Global Flood Awareness System (GloFAS) that\ncouples long- and short-term memory networks with a relaxed water-balance\nconstraint to preserve physical coherence. Five architectures span a continuum\nof information availability: from complete historical and forecast forcings to\nscenarios with data latency and outages, allowing systematic evaluation of\nrobustness. Trained in minimally managed catchments across the United States\nand tested in more than 5,000 basins, including heavily regulated rivers in\nIndia, the emulator reproduces the hydrological core of GloFAS and degrades\nsmoothly as information quality declines. Transfer across contrasting\nhydroclimatic and management regimes yields reduced yet physically consistent\nperformance, defining the limits of generalization under data scarcity and\nhuman influence. The framework establishes operational robustness as a\nmeasurable property of hydrological machine learning and advances the design of\nreliable real-time forecasting systems."}

The paper is under review", "summary": "In this paper, we present SOCIA-Nabla, an end-to-end, agentic framework that\ntreats simulator construction asinstance optimization over code within a\ntextual computation graph. Specialized LLM-driven agents are embedded as graph\nnodes, and a workflow manager executes a loss-driven loop: code synthesis ->\nexecution -> evaluation -> code repair. The optimizer performs Textual-Gradient\nDescent (TGD), while human-in-the-loop interaction is reserved for task-spec\nconfirmation, minimizing expert effort and keeping the code itself as the\ntrainable object. Across three CPS tasks, i.e., User Modeling, Mask Adoption,\nand Personal Mobility, SOCIA-Nabla attains state-of-the-art overall accuracy.\nBy unifying multi-agent orchestration with a loss-aligned optimization view,\nSOCIA-Nabla converts brittle prompt pipelines into reproducible,\nconstraint-aware simulator code generation that scales across domains and\nsimulation granularities. This work is under review, and we will release the\ncode soon."}

While the majority of related work on\nmemorisation has focused on measuring success of training data extraction\nthrough string matching, we argue that embedding models are better suited for\nour specific goals. Distances measured through a high quality embedding model\ncan identify semantic similarities between strings that a different metric such\nas edit distance will struggle to capture. In fact, in our investigation,\napproximate string matching would have severely undercounted (by a conservative\nestimate of $10\\times$) the amount of data that can be extracted due to trivial\nartifacts that deflate the metric. Interestingly, we find that models readily\nregurgitate training data that was used in post-training phases such as SFT or\nRL. We show that this data can be then used to train a base model, recovering a\nmeaningful amount of the original performance. We believe our work exposes a\npossibly overlooked risk towards extracting alignment data. Finally, our work\nopens up an interesting discussion on the downstream effects of distillation\npractices: since models seem to be regurgitating aspects of their training set,\ndistillation can therefore be thought of as indirectly training on the model's\noriginal dataset."}

VAR decomposes the reasoning process into two key\nstages: traceable evidence grounding and search-based chain-of-thought (CoT)\ngeneration, which incorporates a backtracking mechanism for self-correction.\nThe search is guided by a multi-faceted reward function with semantic and\ngeometric self-verification components, which penalize outputs that are not\nfaithfully grounded in the visual input.
