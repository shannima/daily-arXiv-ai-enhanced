Code and data are available at\n  https://github.com/strongSoda/LITERAL-TO-LIBERAL", "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being deployed as the reasoning\nengines for agentic AI systems, yet they exhibit a critical flaw: a rigid\nadherence to explicit rules that leads to decisions misaligned with human\ncommon sense and intent. This \"rule-rigidity\" is a significant barrier to\nbuilding trustworthy autonomous agents. While prior work has shown that\nsupervised fine-tuning (SFT) with human explanations can mitigate this issue,\nSFT is computationally expensive and inaccessible to many practitioners. To\naddress this gap, we introduce the Rule-Intent Distinction (RID) Framework, a\nnovel, low-compute meta-prompting technique designed to elicit human-aligned\nexception handling in LLMs in a zero-shot manner. The RID framework provides\nthe model with a structured cognitive schema for deconstructing tasks,\nclassifying rules, weighing conflicting outcomes, and justifying its final\ndecision. We evaluated the RID framework against baseline and Chain-of-Thought\n(CoT) prompting on a custom benchmark of 20 scenarios requiring nuanced\njudgment across diverse domains. Our human-verified results demonstrate that\nthe RID framework significantly improves performance, achieving a 95% Human\nAlignment Score (HAS), compared to 80% for the baseline and 75% for CoT.\nFurthermore, it consistently produces higher-quality, intent-driven reasoning.\nThis work presents a practical, accessible, and effective method for steering\nLLMs from literal instruction-following to liberal, goal-oriented reasoning,\npaving the way for more reliable and pragmatic AI agents."}

The recent rise of Large Language Models (LLMs)\npresents new opportunities for rethinking time series analysis by integrating\nmultimodal inputs.

An alternative is to perform RL from human feedback, which involves\nlearning a reward function from scratch by collecting human preferences over\npairs of trajectories. However, building such datasets is costly. To address\nthe limitations of both approaches, we propose Preference-Based Reward Repair\n(PBRR): an automated iterative framework that repairs a human-specified proxy\nreward function by learning an additive, transition-dependent correction term\nfrom preferences. A manually specified reward function can yield policies that\nare highly suboptimal under the ground-truth objective, yet corrections on only\na few transitions may suffice to recover optimal performance. To identify and\ncorrect for those transitions, PBRR uses a targeted exploration strategy and a\nnew preference-learning objective.

However, current methods for building assistive agents, whether via\nmimicking expert humans or via RL finetuning on an inferred reward, often\nencourage agents to complete tasks on their own rather than truly assisting the\nhuman attain their objectives. Additionally, these methods often require costly\nexplicit human feedback to provide a training signal. We propose a new approach\nto tuning assistive language models based on maximizing the human's\nempowerment, their ability to effect desired changes in the environment. Our\nempowerment-maximizing method, Empower, only requires offline text data,\nproviding a self-supervised method for fine-tuning language models to better\nassist humans. To study the efficacy of our approach, we conducted an 18-person\nuser study comparing our empowerment assistant with a strong baseline.\nParticipants preferred our assistant 78% of the time (p=0.015), with a 31%\nhigher acceptance rate and 38% fewer suggestions. Additionally, we introduce a\nnew environment for evaluating multi-turn code assistance using simulated\nhumans. Using this environment, we show that agents trained with Empower\nincrease the success rate of a simulated human programmer on challenging coding\nquestions by an average of 192% over an SFT baseline. With this empowerment\nobjective, we provide a framework for useful aligned AI agents at scale using\nonly offline data without the need for any additional human feedback or\nverifiable rewards."}

Nguyen", "Changliu Liu", "Jaime Fernández Fisac", "Andrea Bajcsy"], "title": "From Refusal to Recovery: A Control-Theoretic Approach to Generative AI Guardrails", "comment": null, "summary": "Generative AI systems are increasingly assisting and acting on behalf of end\nusers in practical settings, from digital shopping assistants to\nnext-generation autonomous cars. In this context, safety is no longer about\nblocking harmful content, but about preempting downstream hazards like\nfinancial or physical harm. Yet, most AI guardrails continue to rely on output\nclassification based on labeled datasets and human-specified criteria,making\nthem brittle to new hazardous situations. Even when unsafe conditions are\nflagged, this detection offers no path to recovery: typically, the AI system\nsimply refuses to act--which is not always a safe choice. In this work, we\nargue that agentic AI safety is fundamentally a sequential decision problem:\nharmful outcomes arise from the AI system's continually evolving interactions\nand their downstream consequences on the world. We formalize this through the\nlens of safety-critical control theory, but within the AI model's latent\nrepresentation of the world. This enables us to build predictive guardrails\nthat (i) monitor an AI system's outputs (actions) in real time and (ii)\nproactively correct risky outputs to safe ones, all in a model-agnostic manner\nso the same guardrail can be wrapped around any AI model. We also offer a\npractical training recipe for computing such guardrails at scale via\nsafety-critical reinforcement learning. Our experiments in simulated driving\nand e-commerce settings demonstrate that control-theoretic guardrails can\nreliably steer LLM agents clear of catastrophic outcomes (from collisions to\nbankruptcy) while preserving task performance, offering a principled dynamic\nalternative to today's flag-and-block guardrails."}

To train LLM-based reasoners in such challenging,\nopen-ended settings, strong verifiers capable of catching step-level mistakes\nare necessary prerequisites. We introduce Hard2Verify, a human-annotated,\nstep-level verification benchmark produced with over 500 hours of human labor.\nHard2Verify is designed to rigorously assess step-level verifiers at the\nfrontier: Verifiers must provide step-level annotations or identify the first\nerror in responses generated by frontier LLMs for very recent, challenging, and\nopen-ended math questions. We evaluate 29 generative critics and process reward\nmodels, demonstrating that, beyond a few standouts, open-source verifiers lag\nclosed source models.
