Traditional approaches often rely on predefined\nvalidity frames, which may not always be available or sufficient.

By evaluating whether surrogate models lead to equivalent decisions\ncompared to high-fidelity models, DOTechnique enables efficient identification\nof validity regions, even in the absence of explicit validity boundaries. The\napproach integrates domain constraints and symbolic reasoning to narrow the\nsearch space, enhancing computational efficiency.

Our findings\nshow that all evaluated models systematically inferred unwarranted causal\nrelationships, revealing a strong susceptibility to the illusion of causality.\nWhile there is ongoing debate about whether LLMs genuinely understand causality\nor merely reproduce causal language without true comprehension, our findings\nsupport the latter hypothesis and raise concerns about the use of language\nmodels in domains where accurate causal reasoning is essential for informed\ndecision-making."}

The safety, security, and functionality of these systems are critical,\nespecially in high-stakes applications. However, the current ecosystem of\ninter-agent communication is fragmented, with protocols such as the Model\nContext Protocol (MCP) for tool access and the Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol\nfor coordination being analyzed in isolation. This fragmentation creates a\nsemantic gap that prevents the rigorous analysis of system properties and\nintroduces risks such as architectural misalignment and exploitable\ncoordination issues. To address these challenges, we introduce a modeling\nframework for agentic AI systems composed of two foundational models. The\nfirst, the host agent model, formalizes the top-level entity that interacts\nwith the user, decomposes tasks, and orchestrates their execution by leveraging\nexternal agents and tools. The second, the task lifecycle model, details the\nstates and transitions of individual sub-tasks from creation to completion,\nproviding a fine-grained view of task management and error handling.

Even when\nfine-tuning on benign data or with low-rank adaptation, pre-trained safety\nbehaviors are easily degraded, leading to harmful responses in the fine-tuned\nmodels. To address this challenge, we propose GuardSpace, a guardrail framework\nfor preserving safety alignment throughout fine-tuning, composed of two key\ncomponents: a safety-sensitive subspace and a harmful-resistant null space.\nFirst, we explicitly decompose pre-trained weights into safety-relevant and\nsafety-irrelevant components using covariance-preconditioned singular value\ndecomposition, and initialize low-rank adapters from the safety-irrelevant\nones, while freezing safety-relevant components to preserve their associated\nsafety mechanism. Second, we construct a null space projector that restricts\nadapter updates from altering safe outputs on harmful prompts, thereby\nmaintaining the original refusal behavior. Experiments with various pre-trained\nmodels on multiple downstream tasks demonstrate that GuardSpace achieves\nsuperior performance over existing methods. Notably, for Llama-2-7B-Chat\nfine-tuned on GSM8K, GuardSpace outperforms the state-of-the-art method AsFT,\nreducing the average harmful score from 14.4% to 3.6%, while improving the\naccuracy from from 26.0% to 28.0%."}

Today's\napplications often require LLMs to interact with external tools, marking a\nshift toward more complex agentic systems. To support this, standards such as\nthe Model Context Protocol (MCP) have emerged, enabling agents to access tools\nby including a specification of the capabilities of each tool within the\nprompt. Although this approach expands what agents can do, it also introduces a\ngrowing problem: prompt bloating.

To address this issue, we introduce JSPLIT, a taxonomy-driven framework\ndesigned to help agents manage prompt size more effectively when using large\nsets of MCP tools.

To address this, we introduce the Rose-Frame, a\nthree-dimensional framework for diagnosing cognitive and epistemic drift in\nhuman-AI interaction. The three axes are: (i) Map vs. Territory, which\ndistinguishes representations of reality (epistemology) from reality itself\n(ontology); (ii) Intuition vs. Reason, drawing on dual-process theory to\nseparate fast, emotional judgments from slow, reflective thinking; and (iii)\nConflict vs. Confirmation, which examines whether ideas are critically tested\nthrough disagreement or simply reinforced through mutual validation.

In recent model\nmerging methods, task vector has become a fundamental building block, as it can\nencapsulate the residual information from finetuning. However, the merged model\noften suffers from notable performance degradation due to the conflicts caused\nby task-irrelevant redundancy in task vectors. Existing efforts in overcoming\nredundancy by randomly dropping elements in the parameter space involves\nrandomness and lacks knowledge awareness. To address these challenges, in this\nstudy, we propose Purifying TAsk Vectors (PAVE) in knowledge-aware subspace.\nConcretely, we sample some training examples from each task, and feed them into\ntheir corresponding fine-tuned models to acquire the covariance matrices before\nlinear layers. We then perform a context-oriented singular value decomposition,\nwhich accentuates the weight components most relevant to the target knowledge.\nAs a result, we can split fine-tuned model weights into task-relevant and\nredundant components in the knowledge-aware subspace, and purify the task\nvector by pruning the redundant components. To induce fair pruning efforts\nacross models, we further introduce a spectral rank allocation strategy by\noptimizing a normalized activated pruning error. The task vector purification\nby our method as a plug-and-play scheme is applicable across various task\nvector-based merging methods to improve their performance.
