Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated\nsignificant advancements across various domains including translation and\nsummarization, human consciousness is not something to imitate with current\nupfront technology owing to so-called hallucination. This study, therefore,\nproposes a novel approach to address these challenges by integrating\npsychoanalysis and the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) into constructing\nconsciousness and personality modules. We developed three artificial\nconsciousnesses (self-awareness, unconsciousness, and preconsciousness) based\non the principles of psychoanalysis. Additionally, we designed 16 characters\nwith different personalities representing the sixteen MBTI types, with several\nattributes such as needs, status, and memories. To determine if our model's\nartificial consciousness exhibits human-like cognition, we created ten distinct\nsituations considering seven attributes such as emotional understanding and\nlogical thinking. The decision-making process of artificial consciousness and\nthe final action were evaluated in three ways: survey evaluation, three-tier\nclassification via ChatGPT, and qualitative review. Both quantitative and\nqualitative analyses indicated a high likelihood of well-simulated\nconsciousness, although the difference in response between different characters\nand consciousnesses was not very significant. This implies that the developed\nmodels incorporating elements of psychoanalysis and personality theory can lead\nto building a more intuitive and adaptable AI system with humanoid\nconsciousness.

To address the above\nproblems, this paper proposes a higher-order network dynamics identification\nmethod for long-term dynamic prediction of complex networks. Firstly, to\naddress the problem that traditional graph machine learning can only deal with\npairwise relations, dynamic hypergraph learning is introduced to capture the\nhigher-order non-pairwise relations among complex networks and improve the\naccuracy of complex network modelling.
