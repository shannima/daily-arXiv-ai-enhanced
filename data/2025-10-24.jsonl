The\nalgorithm employs Matrix Product States (MPS) to compactly represent large\nsuperpositions of spin configurations and utilizes a discrete driving schedule\nto guide the MPS toward the ground state. At each step, a driver Hamiltonian --\nincorporating a transverse magnetic field -- is combined with the problem\nHamiltonian to enable spin flips and facilitate quantum tunneling. The MPS is\nupdated using the standard Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) method,\nwhich iteratively minimizes the system's energy via multiple sweeps across the\nspin chain. Despite its heuristic nature, the algorithm reliably identifies\nglobal minima, not merely near-optimal solutions, across diverse QUBO\ninstances. We first demonstrate its effectiveness on intermediate-level Sudoku\npuzzles from publicly available sources, involving over $200$ Ising spins with\nlong-range couplings dictated by constraint satisfaction. We then apply the\nalgorithm to MaxCut problems from the Biq Mac library, successfully solving\ninstances with up to $251$ nodes and $3,265$ edges. We discuss the advantages\nof this quantum-inspired approach, including its scalability, generalizability,\nand suitability for industrial-scale QUBO applications."}

In this paper, we introduce ToolEQA, an agent that integrates\nexternal tools with multi-step reasoning, where external tools can provide more\nuseful information for completing the task, helping the model derive better\nexploration directions in the next step of reasoning and thus obtaining\nadditional effective information. This enables ToolEQA to generate more\naccurate responses with a shorter exploration distance. To enhance the model's\nability for tool-usage and multi-step reasoning, we further design a novel EQA\ndata generation pipeline that automatically constructs large-scale EQA tasks\nwith reasoning trajectories and corresponding answers. Based on the pipeline,\nwe collect the EQA-RT dataset that contains about 18K tasks, divided into a\ntraining set EQA-RT-Train, and two test sets EQA-RT-Seen (scenes overlapping\nwith the training set) and EQA-RT-Unseen (novel scenes). Experiments on\nEQA-RT-Seen and EQA-RT-Unseen show that ToolEQA improves the success rate by\n9.2~20.2% over state-of-the-art baselines, while outperforming the zero-shot\nToolEQA by 10% in success rate. In addition, ToolEQA also achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance on the HM-EQA, OpenEQA, and EXPRESS-Bench\ndatasets, demonstrating its generality. Our homepage see\nhttps://tooleqa.github.io."}
