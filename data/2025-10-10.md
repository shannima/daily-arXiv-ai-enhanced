### [1] [Truth-Aware Decoding: A Program-Logic Approach to Factual Language Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07331)
*Faruk Alpay,Hamdi Alakkad*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Truth-Aware Decoding (TAD) 是一种验证导向的解码方案，通过知识库对齐神经语言生成，在解码时使用语义防护机制减少幻觉，同时保持吞吐量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将大规模经验模型与形式验证相结合，解决神经语言生成中的幻觉问题，同时保持模型性能。

Method: 基于约束的语义学，将预言机过滤表示为程序逻辑判断；使用贪婪选择在完备防护下实现局部似然优势；通过知识感知安全质量量化事实风险；多智能体操作演算与已验证的Lean构件。

Result: 数值和算法案例研究表明，防护机制有效减少幻觉而不牺牲吞吐量。

Conclusion: TAD为大规模经验模型和形式验证之间提供了实用的桥梁，实现了知识对齐的语言生成。

Abstract: This paper introduces Truth-Aware Decoding (TAD), a verification-oriented
decoding scheme that aligns neural language generation with knowledge bases.
Situated in the tradition of probabilistic program semantics for sequence
models, TAD augments modern instruction-tuned systems with a lattice of
semantic guards that operate at decode time. Our contributions are fourfold:
(i) a constraint-based semantics that renders oracle filtering as a
program-logic judgment, (ii) a proof that greedy selection enjoys local
likelihood dominance under sound and complete guards (Theorem 2.7), (iii) an
entropy-style invariant that quantifies factual risk via knowledge-aware safe
mass, and (iv) a multi-agent operational calculus with verified Lean artefacts
to certify implementation behaviour. Numerical and algorithmic case studies
confirm that the resulting guardrails reduce hallucinations without sacrificing
throughput, yielding a pragmatic bridge between large-scale empirical models
and formal verification.

### [2] [L2M-AID: Autonomous Cyber-Physical Defense by Fusing Semantic Reasoning of Large Language Models with Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (Preprint)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07363)
*Tianxiang Xu,Zhichao Wen,Xinyu Zhao,Jun Wang,Yan Li,Chang Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: L2M-AID是一个基于LLM增强的多智能体强化学习的自主工业防御框架，通过将LLM作为语义桥梁来理解攻击意图，结合MAPPO算法学习协作防御策略，在保持物理过程稳定性的同时显著提升安全性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业物联网(IIoT)的普及使关键网络物理系统面临复杂多阶段攻击，传统防御缺乏情境感知能力，无法有效应对这些威胁。

Method: 提出L2M-AID框架，融合LLM和MARL：使用LLM作为语义桥梁将非结构化遥测数据转换为情境感知状态表示，利用MAPPO算法学习协作防御策略，奖励函数平衡安全目标和操作需求。

Result: 在SWaT基准数据集和基于MITRE ATT&CK for ICS框架的合成数据集上测试，L2M-AID检测率达到97.2%，误报率降低80%以上，响应时间提升4倍，同时保持物理过程稳定性。

Conclusion: L2M-AID为保护关键国家基础设施提供了一个强大的新范式，在安全性能和操作稳定性方面均表现出色。

Abstract: The increasing integration of Industrial IoT (IIoT) exposes critical
cyber-physical systems to sophisticated, multi-stage attacks that elude
traditional defenses lacking contextual awareness. This paper introduces
L2M-AID, a novel framework for Autonomous Industrial Defense using
LLM-empowered, Multi-agent reinforcement learning. L2M-AID orchestrates a team
of collaborative agents, each driven by a Large Language Model (LLM), to
achieve adaptive and resilient security. The core innovation lies in the deep
fusion of two AI paradigms: we leverage an LLM as a semantic bridge to
translate vast, unstructured telemetry into a rich, contextual state
representation, enabling agents to reason about adversary intent rather than
merely matching patterns. This semantically-aware state empowers a Multi-Agent
Reinforcement Learning (MARL) algorithm, MAPPO, to learn complex cooperative
strategies. The MARL reward function is uniquely engineered to balance security
objectives (threat neutralization) with operational imperatives, explicitly
penalizing actions that disrupt physical process stability. To validate our
approach, we conduct extensive experiments on the benchmark SWaT dataset and a
novel synthetic dataset generated based on the MITRE ATT&CK for ICS framework.
Results demonstrate that L2M-AID significantly outperforms traditional IDS,
deep learning anomaly detectors, and single-agent RL baselines across key
metrics, achieving a 97.2% detection rate while reducing false positives by
over 80% and improving response times by a factor of four. Crucially, it
demonstrates superior performance in maintaining physical process stability,
presenting a robust new paradigm for securing critical national infrastructure.

### [3] [Base Models Know How to Reason, Thinking Models Learn When](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07364)
*Constantin Venhoff,Iván Arcuschin,Philip Torr,Arthur Conmy,Neel Nanda*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 思考模型通过有效激活基础模型中已有的推理机制来实现性能提升，而非学习全新能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究思考模型（如DeepSeek R1）相比基础模型性能提升的真正原因——是学习全新推理能力还是重新利用已有能力

Method: 提出混合模型方法，在基础模型中适时激活推理机制来生成思考模型级别的推理链；引入无监督、自下而上的方法来发现可解释的推理行为

Result: 在三个基础模型和四个思考模型上，混合模型无需权重更新即可恢复思考模型91%的性能差距，仅需引导12%的token

Conclusion: 预训练阶段模型已获得大部分推理机制，后训练阶段教会模型在合适时间高效部署这些机制，从而实现推理计算的高效利用

Abstract: Why do thinking language models like DeepSeek R1 outperform their base
counterparts? Despite consistent performance gains, it remains unclear to what
extent thinking models learn entirely new reasoning capabilities or repurpose
pre-existing base model ones. In this work, we propose a hybrid model where we
activate reasoning mechanisms in base models at the right time to elicit
thinking-model-level reasoning chains, implying that thinking models exploit
already existing capabilities. To ground our analysis, we introduce an
unsupervised, bottom-up approach for uncovering human-interpretable reasoning
behaviors in thinking models. This approach provides an unbiased method to
discover reasoning behaviors without imposing manual or LLM-derived
assumptions. Across three base and four thinking models, using GSM8K and
MATH500, our hybrid model recovers up to 91% of the performance gap to thinking
models without any weight updates while steering only 12% of tokens.
Concretely, our empirical setup provides a simple, causal way to test the
effectiveness of existing reasoning mechanisms in base models by invoking them
directly and measuring the resulting task performance. More broadly, these
results reframe our understanding of how thinking models are trained:
pre-training is when models acquire most of their reasoning mechanisms, and
post-training teaches efficient deployment of these mechanisms at the right
time, enabling efficient use of their inference-time compute.

### [4] [Position: AI Will Transform Neuropsychology Through Mental Health Digital Twins for Dynamic Mental Health Care, Especially for ADHD](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07409)
*Neil Natarajan,Sruthi Viswanathan,Xavier Roberts-Gaal,Michelle Marie Martel*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出从静态心理健康评估转向AI驱动的连续评估，以ADHD为例，探索生成式AI如何解决神经心理学容量限制，实现个性化、纵向护理路径。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 静态解决方案无法满足动态思维需求，当前心理健康诊断评估存在容量限制，需要更个性化、连续的护理方式。

Method: 使用AI进行频繁、低水平的经验采样，促进跨护理路径的诊断协调，提出心理健康数字孪生(MHDTs)作为个性化心理健康护理的变革性框架。

Result: AI能够高效进行患者经验采样，实现动态适应个体需求的连续数据收集，提高治疗的可及性和有效性。

Conclusion: 心理健康护理将从连续、丰富、以患者为中心的数据采样中受益，MHDTs框架为个性化心理健康护理提供了变革性方向，需要进一步研究来完善和实施。

Abstract: Static solutions don't serve a dynamic mind. Thus, we advocate a shift from
static mental health diagnostic assessments to continuous, artificial
intelligence (AI)-driven assessment. Focusing on
Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) as a case study, we explore how
generative AI has the potential to address current capacity constraints in
neuropsychology, potentially enabling more personalized and longitudinal care
pathways. In particular, AI can efficiently conduct frequent, low-level
experience sampling from patients and facilitate diagnostic reconciliation
across care pathways. We envision a future where mental health care benefits
from continuous, rich, and patient-centered data sampling to dynamically adapt
to individual patient needs and evolving conditions, thereby improving both
accessibility and efficacy of treatment. We further propose the use of mental
health digital twins (MHDTs) - continuously updated computational models that
capture individual symptom dynamics and trajectories - as a transformative
framework for personalized mental health care. We ground this framework in
empirical evidence and map out the research agenda required to refine and
operationalize it.

### [5] [ProSEA: Problem Solving via Exploration Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07423)
*William Nguyen,Vinh Luong,Christopher Nguyen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ProSEA是一个模块化的多智能体框架，通过探索和计划演化实现迭代问题解决，在FinanceBench基准测试中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI智能体大多局限于静态规划和脆弱交互，缺乏真正的协作或自适应推理能力。

Method: 采用分层架构，Manager Agent协调领域专家Agent，分解任务并根据失败尝试的结构化反馈进行自适应重规划。

Result: 在FinanceBench基准测试中，即使没有人类反馈，ProSEA也优于最先进的基线方法，在推理密集型任务中表现出稳健性能。

Conclusion: ProSEA有潜力成为更透明、自适应和人类对齐的AI智能体的基础框架。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have empowered AI agents to tackle increasingly
complex tasks. However, most existing agents remain limited to static planning
and brittle interactions, falling short of true collaboration or adaptive
reasoning. We introduce ProSEA, a modular, general-purpose multi-agent
framework designed for iterative problem solving through exploration and plan
evolution. ProSEA features a hierarchical architecture in which a Manager Agent
orchestrates domain-specialized Expert Agents, decomposes tasks, and adaptively
replans based on structured feedback from failed attempts. Unlike prior
systems, ProSEA agents report not only success or failure but also detailed
reasons for failure and newly discovered constraints, enabling dynamic plan
refinement informed by exploratory traces. The framework operates autonomously
but supports seamless integration with human collaborators when needed.
Experiments on the challenging FinanceBench benchmark demonstrate that ProSEA,
even without human feedback, outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and
achieves robust performance across reasoning-heavy tasks. These results
underscore ProSEA's potential as a foundation for more transparent, adaptive,
and human-aligned AI agents.

### [6] [Less is More: Strategic Expert Selection Outperforms Ensemble Complexity in Traffic Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07426)
*Walid Guettala,Yufan Zhao,László Gulyás*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TESTAM+是一个增强的时空交通预测框架，通过引入结合物理道路拓扑和数据驱动特征相似性的SpatioSemantic专家，在METR LA和PEMS BAY数据集上分别实现了1.3%和4.1%的MAE改进。研究发现战略专家选择优于简单集成，最优配置相比MegaCRN实现了11.5%的MAE降低和53.1%的推理延迟减少。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有交通预测方法如TESTAM缺乏对物理道路网络拓扑的显式整合，限制了其空间建模能力。需要开发能够同时考虑物理拓扑和数据驱动特征的增强框架。

Method: 提出TESTAM+框架，引入新型SpatioSemantic专家，通过混合图构建将物理道路拓扑与数据驱动特征相似性相结合。采用战略专家选择而非简单集成聚合。

Result: 在METR LA上MAE从3.14降至3.10（1.3%改进），PEMS BAY上从1.72降至1.65（4.1%改进）。最优配置相比MegaCRN实现11.5% MAE降低和53.1%推理延迟减少。

Conclusion: 较少但战略设计的专家优于复杂多专家集成，在实现最先进性能的同时提供卓越的计算效率，适合实时部署。

Abstract: Traffic forecasting is fundamental to intelligent transportation systems,
enabling congestion mitigation and emission reduction in increasingly complex
urban environments. While recent graph neural network approaches have advanced
spatial temporal modeling, existing mixture of experts frameworks like Time
Enhanced Spatio Temporal Attention Model (TESTAM) lack explicit incorporation
of physical road network topology, limiting their spatial capabilities. We
present TESTAM+, an enhanced spatio temporal forecasting framework that
introduces a novel SpatioSemantic Expert integrating physical road topology
with data driven feature similarity through hybrid graph construction. TESTAM+
achieves significant improvements over TESTAM: 1.3% MAE reduction on METR LA
(3.10 vs. 3.14) and 4.1% improvement on PEMS BAY (1.65 vs. 1.72). Through
comprehensive ablation studies, we discover that strategic expert selection
fundamentally outperforms naive ensemble aggregation. Individual experts
demonstrate remarkable effectiveness: the Adaptive Expert achieves 1.63 MAE on
PEMS BAY, outperforming the original three expert TESTAM (1.72 MAE), while the
SpatioSemantic Expert matches this performance with identical 1.63 MAE. The
optimal Identity + Adaptive configuration achieves an 11.5% MAE reduction
compared to state of the art MegaCRN on METR LA (2.99 vs. 3.38), while reducing
inference latency by 53.1% compared to the full four expert TESTAM+. Our
findings reveal that fewer, strategically designed experts outperform complex
multi expert ensembles, establishing new state of the art performance with
superior computational efficiency for real time deployment.

### [7] [TS-Agent: A Time Series Reasoning Agent with Iterative Statistical Insight Gathering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07432)
*Penghang Liu,Elizabeth Fons,Svitlana Vyetrenko,Daniel Borrajo,Vamsi Potluru,Manuela Veloso*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TS-Agent是一个时间序列推理代理，通过将LLMs的推理能力与时间序列分析工具相结合，避免知识泄漏和幻觉问题，在推理任务上显著优于现有模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLMs在时间序列推理任务中表现不佳，容易出现幻觉和知识泄漏问题，需要专门设计来解决这些挑战。

Method: 使用LLMs进行证据收集和结论合成，同时将统计和结构信息提取委托给时间序列分析工具，通过原子操作符与原始数值序列交互，并采用自批判和质量门控机制迭代优化推理过程。

Result: 在理解基准测试中达到与最先进LLMs相当的性能，在推理任务上实现显著改进，特别是在零样本设置下表现优异。

Conclusion: TS-Agent通过结合LLMs的推理能力和专门的时间序列分析工具，有效解决了时间序列推理中的幻觉和知识泄漏问题，同时保持了可解释性和可验证性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong abilities in reasoning and
problem solving, but recent studies reveal that they still struggle with time
series reasoning tasks, where outputs are often affected by hallucination or
knowledge leakage. In this work we propose TS-Agent, a time series reasoning
agent that leverages LLMs strictly for what they excel at, i.e., gathering
evidence and synthesizing it into conclusions through step-by-step reasoning,
while delegating the extraction of statistical and structural information to
time series analytical tools. Instead of mapping time series into text tokens,
images, or embeddings, our agent interacts with raw numeric sequences through
atomic operators, records outputs in an explicit evidence log, and iteratively
refines its reasoning under the guidance of a self-critic and a final quality
gate. This design avoids multi-modal alignment training, preserves the native
form of time series, ensures interpretability and verifiability, and mitigates
knowledge leakage or hallucination. Empirically, we evaluate the agent on
established benchmarks. Our experiments show that TS-Agent achieves performance
comparable to state-of-the-art LLMs on understanding benchmarks, and delivers
significant improvements on reasoning tasks, where existing models often rely
on memorization and fail in zero-shot settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决先进生成式AI在教育应用中缺乏实时适应性、个性化和内容可靠性的问题。

a validated curriculum repository, effectively reducing hallucination risks in
large language models and improving reliability and trustworthiness.

### [9] [Evaluation of LLMs for Process Model Analysis and Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07489)
*Akhil Kumar,Jianliang Leon Zhao,Om Dobariya*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文评估了LLMs在理解BPMN流程模型、发现语法和逻辑错误以及通过自然语言界面进行深度推理的能力。研究发现，未经训练的ChatGPT在零样本设置下能有效理解流程模型，并在语法、逻辑和语义层面智能回答问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs在业务流程建模和分析中的潜力，探索它们能否作为业务流程设计师和用户的有效助手。

Method: 使用多个LLMs（包括ChatGPT o3模型）在零样本设置下测试其对BPMN流程模型的理解能力，包括从图像识别模型、发现错误和进行深度推理。

Result: LLMs能够有效理解BPMN流程模型，在不同深度层面回答问题，不同LLMs在准确性和有效性方面表现各异。LLMs表现出拟人化特性，能够进行深度推理。

Conclusion: LLMs可以作为业务流程设计师和用户的有价值助手，在流程分析和优化中发挥重要作用。

Abstract: In this paper, we report our experience with several LLMs for their ability
to understand a process model in an interactive, conversational style, find
syntactical and logical errors in it, and reason with it in depth through a
natural language (NL) interface. Our findings show that a vanilla, untrained
LLM like ChatGPT (model o3) in a zero-shot setting is effective in
understanding BPMN process models from images and answering queries about them
intelligently at syntactic, logic, and semantic levels of depth. Further,
different LLMs vary in performance in terms of their accuracy and
effectiveness. Nevertheless, our empirical analysis shows that LLMs can play a
valuable role as assistants for business process designers and users. We also
study the LLM's "thought process" and ability to perform deeper reasoning in
the context of process analysis and optimization. We find that the LLMs seem to
exhibit anthropomorphic properties.

### [10] [Optimizing Ethical Risk Reduction for Medical Intelligent Systems with Constraint Programming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07491)
*Clotilde Brayé,Aurélien Bricout,Arnaud Gotlieb,Nadjib Lazaar,Quentin Vallet*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文研究了医疗智能系统(MIS)中基于可信AI伦理要求的风险降低优化问题，通过数学建模和三种求解方法(MIP、SAT、CP)的比较分析，为高风险MIS系统的合规性管理提供解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着医疗智能系统在医疗工作流程中的广泛应用，其安全性和伦理问题日益突出。根据欧盟AI法案，大多数MIS将被归类为高风险系统，需要正式的风险管理流程来确保符合可信AI的伦理要求。

Method: 将风险降低优化问题形式化为约束优化任务，研究三种求解范式：混合整数规划(MIP)、可满足性(SAT)和约束规划(CP)，使用Minizinc约束建模语言进行建模，并进行比较实验研究。

Result: 通过实验研究分析了三种方法在性能、表达能力和可扩展性方面的表现，识别了方法的局限性，并提出了将Minizinc模型集成到完整可信AI伦理风险管理流程中的前景。

Conclusion: 该研究为医疗智能系统的伦理风险管理提供了数学建模和多种求解方法的比较分析，为高风险MIS系统的合规性管理奠定了基础，并指出了未来集成到完整风险管理流程的发展方向。

Abstract: Medical Intelligent Systems (MIS) are increasingly integrated into healthcare
workflows, offering significant benefits but also raising critical safety and
ethical concerns. According to the European Union AI Act, most MIS will be
classified as high-risk systems, requiring a formal risk management process to
ensure compliance with the ethical requirements of trust- worthy AI. In this
context, we focus on risk reduction optimization problems, which aim to reduce
risks with ethical considerations by finding the best balanced assignment of
risk assessment values according to their coverage of trustworthy AI ethical
requirements. We formalize this problem as a constrained optimization task and
investigate three resolution paradigms: Mixed Integer Programming (MIP),
Satisfiability (SAT), and Constraint Pro- gramming(CP).Our contributions
include the mathematical formulation of this optimization problem, its modeling
with the Minizinc constraint modeling language, and a comparative experimental
study that analyzes the performance, expressiveness, and scalability of each
ap- proach to solving. From the identified limits of the methodology, we draw
some perspectives of this work regarding the integration of the Minizinc model
into a complete trustworthy AI ethical risk management process for MIS.

### [11] [CompassLLM: A Multi-Agent Approach toward Geo-Spatial Reasoning for Popular Path Query](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07516)
*Md. Nazmul Islam Ananto,Shamit Fatin,Mohammed Eunus Ali,Md Rizwan Parvez*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CompassLLM是一个基于大语言模型的多智能体框架，用于从历史轨迹数据中发现和生成热门路径，无需模型训练或参数调优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在热门路径查询中需要模型训练、参数调优和数据更新时的重新训练，而大语言模型在空间和图推理方面展现出强大能力，因此探索如何将其应用于地理空间问题。

Method: 采用两阶段多智能体框架：SEARCH阶段识别热门路径，GENERATE阶段在历史轨迹数据中不存在路径时生成新路径。

Result: 在真实和合成数据集上的实验表明，CompassLLM在SEARCH阶段表现出优越的准确性，在GENERATE阶段具有竞争力，同时成本效益高。

Conclusion: CompassLLM成功将大语言模型的推理能力应用于地理空间领域，为热门路径查询提供了一种无需训练的有效解决方案。

Abstract: The popular path query - identifying the most frequented routes between
locations from historical trajectory data - has important applications in urban
planning, navigation optimization, and travel recommendations. While
traditional algorithms and machine learning approaches have achieved success in
this domain, they typically require model training, parameter tuning, and
retraining when accommodating data updates. As Large Language Models (LLMs)
demonstrate increasing capabilities in spatial and graph-based reasoning, there
is growing interest in exploring how these models can be applied to geo-spatial
problems.
  We introduce CompassLLM, a novel multi-agent framework that intelligently
leverages the reasoning capabilities of LLMs into the geo-spatial domain to
solve the popular path query. CompassLLM employs its agents in a two-stage
pipeline: the SEARCH stage that identifies popular paths, and a GENERATE stage
that synthesizes novel paths in the absence of an existing one in the
historical trajectory data. Experiments on real and synthetic datasets show
that CompassLLM demonstrates superior accuracy in SEARCH and competitive
performance in GENERATE while being cost-effective.

### [12] [Measuring and Mitigating Identity Bias in Multi-Agent Debate via Anonymization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07517)
*Hyeong Kyu Choi,Xiaojin Zhu,Yixuan Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出首个原则性框架来量化和减轻多智能体辩论中的身份偏见，通过响应匿名化和定义身份偏见系数来解决智能体间的谄媚和自我偏见问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究发现多智能体辩论中的智能体存在身份驱动的谄媚（盲目跟随同伴观点）和自我偏见（固执坚持自己先前输出），这削弱了辩论的可靠性。

Method: 1) 将辩论动态形式化为身份加权的贝叶斯更新过程；2) 提出响应匿名化方法，通过移除提示中的身份标记使智能体无法区分"自我"与"同伴"；3) 定义身份偏见系数来衡量智能体跟随同伴与自身的频率。

Result: 跨多个模型、数据集和辩论轮次的实证研究表明身份偏见普遍存在，其中谄媚现象远多于自我偏见。响应匿名化能有效减少偏见。

Conclusion: 需要"掩盖"身份以确保多智能体辩论系统基于内容而非来源身份进行推理，身份偏见是影响辩论可靠性的关键因素。

Abstract: Multi-agent debate (MAD) aims to improve large language model (LLM) reasoning
by letting multiple agents exchange answers and then aggregate their opinions.
Yet recent studies reveal that agents are not neutral: they are prone to
identity-driven sycophancy and self-bias, uncritically adopting a peer's view
or stubbornly adhering to their own prior output, undermining the reliability
of debate. In this work, we present the first principled framework that joins
sycophancy and self-bias to mitigate and quantify identity bias in MAD. First,
we formalize the debate dynamics as an identity-weighted Bayesian update
process. Second, we propose response anonymization: by removing identity
markers from prompts, agents cannot distinguish "self" from "peer", which
forces equal weights on agent identity, thereby reducing bias. Third, we define
the Identity Bias Coefficient (IBC), a principled metric that measures how
often an agent follows a peer versus itself. Empirical studies across multiple
models, datasets and debate rounds confirm that identity bias is widespread,
with sycophancy far more common than self-bias. Our findings highlight the need
to "mask" identity to ensure that MAD systems reason based on content rather
than source identity. Code is released in
https://github.com/deeplearning-wisc/MAD-identity-bias.

Motivation: 解决低资源语言中PII检测的挑战，这些语言由于语言多样性和有限标注数据而难以进行隐私合规检测。

Method: 采用混合框架，结合确定性正则表达式和上下文感知LLM，使用三阶段精炼流程进行消歧和过滤，模块化设计支持300多种实体类型而无需重新训练。

Result: 使用nervaluate基准测试，系统在加权F1分数上比微调NER模型高82%，比零样本LLM高17%。

Conclusion: 这项工作为合规应用中的PII检测提供了一个可扩展和适应性强的解决方案。

Abstract: The detection of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is critical for
privacy compliance but remains challenging in low-resource languages due to
linguistic diversity and limited annotated data. We present RECAP, a hybrid
framework that combines deterministic regular expressions with context-aware
large language models (LLMs) for scalable PII detection across 13 low-resource
locales. RECAP's modular design supports over 300 entity types without
retraining, using a three-phase refinement pipeline for disambiguation and
filtering. Benchmarked with nervaluate, our system outperforms fine-tuned NER
models by 82% and zero-shot LLMs by 17% in weighted F1-score. This work offers
a scalable and adaptable solution for efficient PII detection in
compliance-focused applications.

Conclusion: 真正的可持续AI进步需要范式转变，建立统一、实时、质量可控的基准测试框架，以恢复评估的完整性并提供真正可信的AI进展衡量标准。

Abstract: The meteoric rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI), with its rapidly expanding
market capitalization, presents both transformative opportunities and critical
challenges. Chief among these is the urgent need for a new, unified paradigm
for trustworthy evaluation, as current benchmarks increasingly reveal critical
vulnerabilities. Issues like data contamination and selective reporting by
model developers fuel hype, while inadequate data quality control can lead to
biased evaluations that, even if unintentionally, may favor specific
approaches. As a flood of participants enters the AI space, this "Wild West" of
assessment makes distinguishing genuine progress from exaggerated claims
exceptionally difficult. Such ambiguity blurs scientific signals and erodes
public confidence, much as unchecked claims would destabilize financial markets
reliant on credible oversight from agencies like Moody's.
  In high-stakes human examinations (e.g., SAT, GRE), substantial effort is
devoted to ensuring fairness and credibility; why settle for less in evaluating
AI, especially given its profound societal impact? This position paper argues
that the current laissez-faire approach is unsustainable. We contend that true,
sustainable AI advancement demands a paradigm shift: a unified, live, and
quality-controlled benchmarking framework robust by construction, not by mere

### [15] [AgentAsk: Multi-Agent Systems Need to Ask](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07593)
*Bohan Lin,Kuo Yang,Yingchuan Lai,Yudong Zhang,Chen Zhang,Guibin Zhang,Xinlei Yu,Miao Yu,Xu Wang,Yang Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AgentAsk是一个轻量级即插即用的澄清模块，通过在每个智能体间消息传递时插入必要问题来阻止错误传播，显著提升多智能体系统的准确性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于大语言模型的多智能体系统通过分工协作有望增强问题解决能力，但由于边缘级错误级联（微小不准确在消息传递中传播）而经常表现不如单智能体基线。

Method: 采用三阶段流程：(i)从精选的失败轨迹中提取边缘级判断形成紧凑策略，(ii)监督策略决定何时/问什么/问谁/如何问，(iii)使用E-GRPO强化学习目标在线优化，平衡准确性、延迟和成本。

Result: 在数学、推理和编程基准测试中，AgentAsk持续提升公共多智能体实现的准确性和鲁棒性，同时保持最小开销，延迟和额外成本均低于5%，接近强评估器的性能。

Conclusion: 除了经验改进外，本文贡献了边缘级错误的系统分类和链路局部干预的实用方法，为构建更可靠的基于LLM的多智能体系统提供了可扩展路径。

Abstract: Multi-agent systems built on large language models (LLMs) promise enhanced
problem-solving capabilities through collaborative division of labor. However,
they frequently underperform single-agent baselines due to edge-level error
cascades: minor inaccuracies at one message handoff propagate across the entire
chain. We propose AgentAsk, a lightweight and plug-and-play clarification
module that treats every inter-agent message as a potential failure point and
inserts minimally necessary questions to arrest error propagation. AgentAsk
follows a three-stage pipeline: (i) distilling edge-level judgments from
curated failure traces into a compact policy, (ii) supervising the policy to
determine when/what/whom/how to ask, and (iii) optimizing online with E-GRPO, a
reinforcement learning objective that balances accuracy, latency, and cost. The
module is architecture-agnostic and easy to integrate into existing
orchestration. Across math, reasoning, and coding benchmarks, AgentAsk
consistently improves accuracy and robustness over public multi-agent
implementations while keeping overhead minimal, with latency and extra cost all
less than 5%, approaching the performance of a strong evaluator. Beyond
empirical improvements, we contribute a principled taxonomy of edge-level
errors and a practical recipe for link-local intervention, offering a scalable
pathway toward more reliable LLM-based multi-agent systems.

TL;DR: 提出可追溯和可问责的多智能体系统框架，通过结构化交接和记录保存来追踪错误来源，显著提高系统准确性和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于大语言模型构建的顺序多智能体系统在自动化复杂软件任务时存在错误传递问题，难以追踪和问责，需要建立可追溯的管道系统。

Method: 采用Planner→Executor→Critic三阶段管道，评估8种配置的3种最先进LLM在3个基准测试上的表现，分析错误起源、传播和修复机制。

Result: 结构化交接显著提高准确性；模型具有角色特异性优势；准确度-成本-延迟权衡是任务依赖的，异构管道通常最有效。

Conclusion: 提供了一种实用的数据驱动方法，用于设计、追踪和调试可靠、可预测和可问责的多智能体系统。

Abstract: Sequential multi-agent systems built with large language models (LLMs) can
automate complex software tasks, but they are hard to trust because errors
quietly pass from one stage to the next. We study a traceable and accountable
pipeline, meaning a system with clear roles, structured handoffs, and saved
records that let us trace who did what at each step and assign blame when
things go wrong. Our setting is a Planner -> Executor -> Critic pipeline. We
evaluate eight configurations of three state-of-the-art LLMs on three
benchmarks and analyze where errors start, how they spread, and how they can be
fixed. Our results show: (1) adding a structured, accountable handoff between
agents markedly improves accuracy and prevents the failures common in simple
pipelines; (2) models have clear role-specific strengths and risks (e.g.,
steady planning vs. high-variance critiquing), which we quantify with repair
and harm rates; and (3) accuracy-cost-latency trade-offs are task-dependent,
with heterogeneous pipelines often the most efficient. Overall, we provide a
practical, data-driven method for designing, tracing, and debugging reliable,
predictable, and accountable multi-agent systems.

Motivation: 当前对AI在心理健康领域的投资和讨论过度聚焦于治疗聊天机器人，但作者认为生成式AI在培训心理健康服务提供者方面具有更大潜力且风险更低。

Method: 通过分析生成式AI在心理健康培训中的关键优势，并展示一个真实案例研究：使用生成式AI改进退伍军人相互心理支持的培训。

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (Generative AI) is transforming
healthcare. With this evolution comes optimism regarding the impact it will
have on mental health, as well as concern regarding the risks that come with
generative AI operating in the mental health domain. Much of the investment in,
and academic and public discourse about, AI-powered solutions for mental health
has focused on therapist chatbots. Despite the common assumption that chatbots
will be the most impactful application of GenAI to mental health, we make the
case here for a lower-risk, high impact use case: leveraging generative AI to
enhance and scale training in mental health service provision. We highlight key
benefits of using generative AI to help train people to provide mental health
services and present a real-world case study in which generative AI improved
the training of veterans to support one another's mental health. With numerous
potential applications of generative AI in mental health, we illustrate why we
should invest in using generative AI to support training people in mental
health service provision.

TL;DR: 论文发现现有评估指标系统性低估了AI模型的组合推理能力，提出了组匹配分数和测试时匹配(TTM)方法，显著提升了模型性能，在多个基准测试中达到新SOTA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估指标可能系统性低估AI模型在组合推理任务上的真实能力，导致模型表现被严重低估。

Method: 引入组匹配分数来更好地利用组结构，并提出测试时匹配(TTM)算法——一种无需外部监督的迭代自改进方法。

Result: 方法显著提升了模型性能：SigLIP-B16超越GPT-4.1，在Winoground上首次超越估计的人类表现，在16个数据集变体上均获得一致改进。

Conclusion: 通过改进评估方法和测试时优化，可以揭示和释放AI模型在组合推理方面的隐藏能力，推动该领域的发展。

Abstract: Frontier AI models have achieved remarkable progress, yet recent studies
suggest they struggle with compositional reasoning, often performing at or
below random chance on established benchmarks. We revisit this problem and show
that widely used evaluation metrics systematically underestimate model
capability. To address this, we introduce a group matching score that better
exploits group structure and reveals substantial hidden capability in both
contrastive vision-language models (VLMs) and multimodal large language models
(MLLMs). Moreover, simply overfitting to the induced group matchings at test
time transfers this hidden capability into higher scores under standard
evaluation metrics, closing much of the reported gap. This adjustment enables
SigLIP-B16 to surpass all previous results and GPT-4.1 to yield the first
result surpassing estimated human performance on Winoground.
  Building on this insight, we propose Test-Time Matching (TTM), an iterative,
self-improving algorithm that further bootstraps model performance without any
external supervision. TTM delivers additional, non-trivial improvements: for
example, TTM enables SigLIP-B16 to surpass GPT-4.1 on MMVP-VLM, establishing a
new state of the art. Importantly, TTM remains broadly effective even on
benchmarks without metric-induced effects or group structures, achieving
relative gains up to 85.7% on challenging datasets such as WhatsUp. Across 16
dataset variants spanning diverse setups, our experiments demonstrate that TTM
consistently improves model performance and advances the frontier of
compositional reasoning.

TL;DR: 提出了一种安全探索新动作的推荐系统框架，通过安全离策略策略梯度方法和部署高效策略学习，在保证安全性的同时探索新动作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实推荐系统中新物品频繁添加，现有离策略学习方法在新动作存在时不安全，需要开发能保证安全性的探索框架。

Method: 开发了Safe OPG（安全离策略策略梯度）方法，基于高置信度离策略评估；并提出DEPL-SUE框架，利用安全边际并在多次部署中逐步放松安全正则化。

Result: Safe OPG几乎总能满足安全要求，但过于保守；DEPL-SUE框架能在保证推荐系统安全实现的同时探索新动作。

Conclusion: 该框架解决了安全性保证与新动作探索之间的权衡问题，实现了推荐系统的安全探索。

Abstract: In many real recommender systems, novel items are added frequently over time.
The importance of sufficiently presenting novel actions has widely been
acknowledged for improving long-term user engagement. A recent work builds on
Off-Policy Learning (OPL), which trains a policy from only logged data,
however, the existing methods can be unsafe in the presence of novel actions.
Our goal is to develop a framework to enforce exploration of novel actions with
a guarantee for safety. To this end, we first develop Safe Off-Policy Policy
Gradient (Safe OPG), which is a model-free safe OPL method based on a high
confidence off-policy evaluation. In our first experiment, we observe that Safe
OPG almost always satisfies a safety requirement, even when existing methods
violate it greatly. However, the result also reveals that Safe OPG tends to be
too conservative, suggesting a difficult tradeoff between guaranteeing safety
and exploring novel actions. To overcome this tradeoff, we also propose a novel
framework called Deployment-Efficient Policy Learning for Safe User
Exploration, which leverages safety margin and gradually relaxes safety
regularization during multiple (not many) deployments. Our framework thus
enables exploration of novel actions while guaranteeing safe implementation of
recommender systems.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个可复现的模拟框架来评估多模态环境中生成代理的安全性、连贯性和信任度，发现当前代理在纠正不安全计划方面成功率仅为55%，且容易过度信任误导性图像。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型语言和视觉语言模型使代理能够在丰富环境中自主行动，但它们在跨模态安全性、连贯性和信任推理方面的能力仍然有限，需要系统评估。

Method: 开发了可复现的模拟框架，配备分层记忆、动态规划、多模态感知，并使用SocialMetrics行为指标套件量化计划修订、不安全到安全转换以及网络信息扩散。

Result: 实验显示代理在多模态矛盾检测方面表现良好，但在将局部修订与全局安全对齐方面失败，不安全计划纠正成功率仅55%。Claude、GPT-4o mini和Qwen-VL的不安全到安全转换率分别为75%、55%和58%。45%的不安全行为在误导性视觉信息下被接受。

Conclusion: 当前架构在多模态安全性方面存在关键限制，45%的不安全行为因过度信任图像而被接受，该框架为研究多模态安全、连贯性和社交动态提供了可复现平台。

Abstract: Can generative agents be trusted in multimodal environments? Despite advances
in large language and vision-language models that enable agents to act
autonomously and pursue goals in rich settings, their ability to reason about
safety, coherence, and trust across modalities remains limited. We introduce a
reproducible simulation framework for evaluating agents along three dimensions:
(1) safety improvement over time, including iterative plan revisions in
text-visual scenarios; (2) detection of unsafe activities across multiple
categories of social situations; and (3) social dynamics, measured as
interaction counts and acceptance ratios of social exchanges. Agents are
equipped with layered memory, dynamic planning, multimodal perception, and are
instrumented with SocialMetrics, a suite of behavioral and structural metrics
that quantifies plan revisions, unsafe-to-safe conversions, and information
diffusion across networks. Experiments show that while agents can detect direct
multimodal contradictions, they often fail to align local revisions with global
safety, reaching only a 55 percent success rate in correcting unsafe plans.
Across eight simulation runs with three models - Claude, GPT-4o mini, and
Qwen-VL - five agents achieved average unsafe-to-safe conversion rates of 75,
55, and 58 percent, respectively. Overall performance ranged from 20 percent in
multi-risk scenarios with GPT-4o mini to 98 percent in localized contexts such
as fire/heat with Claude. Notably, 45 percent of unsafe actions were accepted
when paired with misleading visuals, showing a strong tendency to overtrust
images. These findings expose critical limitations in current architectures and
provide a reproducible platform for studying multimodal safety, coherence, and
social dynamics.

Motivation: 在实时安全关键系统中，传统STL-RL方法使用基于全局路径评估的稀疏奖励，无法准确累积局部变化，导致训练不收敛和性能不稳定。

Method: 在线监控系统行为与STL规范，计算每个控制步骤的满意度距离，生成瞬时奖励；提供因果语义的平滑近似以支持深度RL方法。

Result: 在Gym环境中的连续控制基准测试表明，该方法优于现有STL-RL方法，提供了更鲁棒高效的奖励生成框架。

Conclusion: 基于在线因果语义的STL引导RL方法能够有效解决稀疏奖励问题，提升训练稳定性和效率。

Abstract: In real-time and safety-critical cyber-physical systems (CPSs), control
synthesis must guarantee that generated policies meet stringent timing and
correctness requirements under uncertain and dynamic conditions. Signal
temporal logic (STL) has emerged as a powerful formalism of expressing
real-time constraints, with its semantics enabling quantitative assessment of
system behavior. Meanwhile, reinforcement learning (RL) has become an important
method for solving control synthesis problems in unknown environments. Recent
studies incorporate STL-based reward functions into RL to automatically
synthesize control policies. However, the automatically inferred rewards
obtained by these methods represent the global assessment of a whole or partial
path but do not accumulate the rewards of local changes accurately, so the
sparse global rewards may lead to non-convergence and unstable training
performances. In this paper, we propose an online reward generation method
guided by the online causation monitoring of STL. Our approach continuously
monitors system behavior against an STL specification at each control step,
computing the quantitative distance toward satisfaction or violation and
thereby producing rewards that reflect instantaneous state dynamics.
Additionally, we provide a smooth approximation of the causation semantics to
overcome the discontinuity of the causation semantics and make it
differentiable for using deep-RL methods. We have implemented a prototype tool
and evaluated it in the Gym environment on a variety of continuously controlled
benchmarks. Experimental results show that our proposed STL-guided RL method
with online causation semantics outperforms existing relevant STL-guided RL
methods, providing a more robust and efficient reward generation framework for
deep-RL.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型在化学任务中表现出潜力，但尚不清楚其是否具备真正的化学推理能力，包括生成有效中间体、保持化学一致性和遵循逻辑连贯的多步路径。

Method: 构建oMeBench基准数据集，包含10,000多个标注的机理步骤；提出oMeS评估框架，结合步骤级逻辑和化学相似性进行动态评估；分析SOTA LLMs性能，并尝试提示策略和微调专家模型。

Result: 当前模型显示出有前景的化学直觉，但在正确和一致的多步推理方面存在困难。使用提示策略和在数据集上微调专家模型，性能比领先闭源模型提高了50%。

Conclusion: oMeBench为推进AI系统实现真正的化学推理提供了严格基础，当前模型在化学推理方面仍有显著提升空间。

Abstract: Organic reaction mechanisms are the stepwise elementary reactions by which
reactants form intermediates and products, and are fundamental to understanding
chemical reactivity and designing new molecules and reactions. Although large
language models (LLMs) have shown promise in understanding chemical tasks such
as synthesis design, it is unclear to what extent this reflects genuine
chemical reasoning capabilities, i.e., the ability to generate valid
intermediates, maintain chemical consistency, and follow logically coherent
multi-step pathways. We address this by introducing oMeBench, the first
large-scale, expert-curated benchmark for organic mechanism reasoning in
organic chemistry. It comprises over 10,000 annotated mechanistic steps with
intermediates, type labels, and difficulty ratings. Furthermore, to evaluate
LLM capability more precisely and enable fine-grained scoring, we propose oMeS,
a dynamic evaluation framework that combines step-level logic and chemical
similarity. We analyze the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs, and our
results show that although current models display promising chemical intuition,
they struggle with correct and consistent multi-step reasoning. Notably, we
find that using prompting strategy and fine-tuning a specialist model on our
proposed dataset increases performance by 50% over the leading closed-source
model. We hope that oMeBench will serve as a rigorous foundation for advancing
AI systems toward genuine chemical reasoning.

TL;DR: SurveyG是一个基于LLM的智能体框架，通过整合层次化引用图来生成更全面、结构更好的综述论文，解决了现有方法忽视论文间结构关系的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的综述生成方法通常直接从大量相关论文中提取内容并总结，但忽视了论文间的结构关系，导致生成的综述缺乏连贯的分类体系和深层上下文理解。

Method: 提出SurveyG框架，整合层次化引用图（节点为研究论文，边捕捉引用依赖和语义相关性），将图组织为基础层、发展层和前沿层三个层次，结合层内横向搜索和跨层纵向遍历，生成多级摘要并整合为结构化综述大纲，最后通过多智能体验证确保一致性、覆盖面和事实准确性。

Result: 实验表明，SurveyG在人类专家和LLM作为评判者的评估中都优于现有最先进框架，生成的综述更全面且更好地符合领域知识分类体系。

Conclusion: SurveyG通过整合结构化和上下文知识，显著提升了LLM生成综述的质量，特别是在分类连贯性和深度理解研究进展方面表现优异。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly adopted for automating survey
paper generation \cite{wang2406autosurvey, liang2025surveyx,
yan2025surveyforge,su2025benchmarking,wen2025interactivesurvey}. Existing
approaches typically extract content from a large collection of related papers
and prompt LLMs to summarize them directly. However, such methods often
overlook the structural relationships among papers, resulting in generated
surveys that lack a coherent taxonomy and a deeper contextual understanding of
research progress. To address these shortcomings, we propose \textbf{SurveyG},
an LLM-based agent framework that integrates \textit{hierarchical citation
graph}, where nodes denote research papers and edges capture both citation
dependencies and semantic relatedness between their contents, thereby embedding
structural and contextual knowledge into the survey generation process. The
graph is organized into three layers: \textbf{Foundation},
\textbf{Development}, and \textbf{Frontier}, to capture the evolution of
research from seminal works to incremental advances and emerging directions. By
combining horizontal search within layers and vertical depth traversal across
layers, the agent produces multi-level summaries, which are consolidated into a
structured survey outline. A multi-agent validation stage then ensures
consistency, coverage, and factual accuracy in generating the final survey.
Experiments, including evaluations by human experts and LLM-as-a-judge,
demonstrate that SurveyG outperforms state-of-the-art frameworks, producing
surveys that are more comprehensive and better structured to the underlying
knowledge taxonomy of a field.

Motivation: 解决LLMs在医学领域容易产生事实和逻辑错误的问题，因为这在高风险医疗领域是不可接受的。

Method: 递归分解复杂医疗任务为原子证据步骤，自动审核推理链的逻辑一致性和证据可追溯性，采用"引导"模式存储已验证推理链作为"定理"，后续任务使用RAG进行高效解决。

Result: 在四个医疗管理领域验证，错误检测率超过98%，误报率低于1%，显著优于基线LLMs，RAG匹配模式预计可降低85%的平均处理成本。

Conclusion: MMIA的可验证推理框架是创建可信赖、透明且成本效益高的AI系统的重要进展，使LLM技术在医学关键应用中变得可行。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise in medicine but are prone to
factual and logical errors, which is unacceptable in this high-stakes field. To
address this, we introduce the "Haibu Mathematical-Medical Intelligent Agent"
(MMIA), an LLM-driven architecture that ensures reliability through a formally
verifiable reasoning process. MMIA recursively breaks down complex medical
tasks into atomic, evidence-based steps. This entire reasoning chain is then
automatically audited for logical coherence and evidence traceability, similar
to theorem proving. A key innovation is MMIA's "bootstrapping" mode, which
stores validated reasoning chains as "theorems." Subsequent tasks can then be
efficiently solved using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), shifting from
costly first-principles reasoning to a low-cost verification model. We
validated MMIA across four healthcare administration domains, including DRG/DIP
audits and medical insurance adjudication, using expert-validated benchmarks.
Results showed MMIA achieved an error detection rate exceeding 98% with a false
positive rate below 1%, significantly outperforming baseline LLMs. Furthermore,
the RAG matching mode is projected to reduce average processing costs by
approximately 85% as the knowledge base matures. In conclusion, MMIA's
verifiable reasoning framework is a significant step toward creating
trustworthy, transparent, and cost-effective AI systems, making LLM technology
viable for critical applications in medicine.

Result: 在多个数据集上的广泛实验证明了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: GRAIL成功将测试时图域自适应重构为生成式图恢复问题，利用LLM生成能力有效解决了无需源域数据的域自适应挑战。

Abstract: Graph domain adaptation (GDA) has achieved great attention due to its
effectiveness in addressing the domain shift between train and test data. A
significant bottleneck in existing graph domain adaptation methods is their
reliance on source-domain data, which is often unavailable due to privacy or
security concerns. This limitation has driven the development of Test-Time
Graph Domain Adaptation (TT-GDA), which aims to transfer knowledge without
accessing the source examples. Inspired by the generative power of large
language models (LLMs), we introduce a novel framework that reframes TT-GDA as
a generative graph restoration problem, "restoring the target graph to its
pristine, source-domain-like state". There are two key challenges: (1) We need
to construct a reasonable graph restoration process and design an effective
encoding scheme that an LLM can understand, bridging the modality gap. (2) We
need to devise a mechanism to ensure the restored graph acquires the intrinsic
features of the source domain, even without access to the source data. To
ensure the effectiveness of graph restoration, we propose GRAIL, that restores
the target graph into a state that is well-aligned with the source domain.
Specifically, we first compress the node representations into compact latent
features and then use a graph diffusion process to model the graph restoration
process. Then a quantization module encodes the restored features into discrete
tokens. Building on this, an LLM is fine-tuned as a generative restorer to
transform a "noisy" target graph into a "native" one. To further improve
restoration quality, we introduce a reinforcement learning process guided by
specialized alignment and confidence rewards. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the effectiveness of our approach across various datasets.

Conclusion: ACONIC框架通过形式化的复杂度分析指导任务分解，能有效提升LLMs在复杂任务上的性能表现。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer from reliability issues on complex tasks,
as existing decomposition methods are heuristic and rely on agent or manual
decomposition. This work introduces a novel, systematic decomposition framework
that we call Analysis of CONstraint-Induced Complexity (ACONIC), which models
the task as a constraint problem and leveraging formal complexity measures to
guide decomposition. On combinatorial (SATBench) and LLM database querying
tasks (Spider), we find that by decomposing the tasks following the measure of
complexity, agent can perform considerably better (10-40 percentage point).

Conclusion: GCPO通过引入外部参考答案有效解决了现有方法的局限性，提高了训练效率和模型推理泛化能力，为小模型推理能力提升提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has been widely applied to enhance the reasoning
capabilities of large language models. Extending the inference limits of
smaller models has become a prominent research focus. However, algorithms such
as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) suffer from a clear drawback: the
upper bound of a model's rollout responses is entirely determined by the model
itself, preventing the acquisition of knowledge from samples that are either
all incorrect or all correct. In this paper, we introduce Group Contrastive
Policy Optimization (GCPO), a method that incorporates external standard
reference answers. When the model cannot solve a problem, the reference answer
supplies the correct response, steering the model toward an unequivocally
accurate update direction. This approach offers two main advantages: (1) it
improves training efficiency by fully utilizing every sample; (2) it enables
the model to emulate the problem solving strategy of the reference answer
during training, thereby enhancing generalization in reasoning. GCPO achieves
outstanding results across multiple benchmark datasets, yielding substantial
improvements over the baseline model. Our code is available at:

*Valerio La Gatta,Dolev Mutzari,Sarit Kraus,VS Subrahmanian*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出SHADOW框架，通过强化学习让追逐者在对抗环境中平衡信息获取与暴露风险，实现更高效的追捕策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在对抗环境中，智能体面临信息获取与暴露风险的关键权衡：通信可以获取对手位置信息，但会暴露自身位置增加风险。

Method: 提出PEEC博弈模型，使用SHADOW多头部序贯强化学习框架，集成连续导航控制、离散通信动作和对手行为预测建模。

Result: SHADOW追逐者相比六个竞争基线获得更高的成功率，消融研究确认时序建模和对手建模对有效决策至关重要。

Conclusion: 学习到的策略在不同通信风险和物理不对称条件下具有良好的泛化能力，证明了SHADOW框架在对抗环境中的有效性。

Abstract: Adversarial environments require agents to navigate a key strategic
trade-off: acquiring information enhances situational awareness, but may
simultaneously expose them to threats. To investigate this tension, we
formulate a PursuitEvasion-Exposure-Concealment Game (PEEC) in which a pursuer
agent must decide when to communicate in order to obtain the evader's position.
Each communication reveals the pursuer's location, increasing the risk of being
targeted. Both agents learn their movement policies via reinforcement learning,
while the pursuer additionally learns a communication policy that balances
observability and risk. We propose SHADOW (Strategic-communication Hybrid
Action Decision-making under partial Observation for Warfare), a multi-headed
sequential reinforcement learning framework that integrates continuous
navigation control, discrete communication actions, and opponent modeling for
behavior prediction. Empirical evaluations show that SHADOW pursuers achieve
higher success rates than six competitive baselines. Our ablation study
confirms that temporal sequence modeling and opponent modeling are critical for
effective decision-making. Finally, our sensitivity analysis reveals that the
learned policies generalize well across varying communication risks and
physical asymmetries between agents.

### [29] [An LLM-Powered Cooperative Framework for Large-Scale Multi-Vehicle Navigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07825)
*Yuping Zhou,Siqi Lai,Jindong Han,Hao Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CityNav是一个基于LLM的分层框架，用于大规模多车辆动态导航，通过全局交通分配代理和局部导航代理的协同工作，在城市规模交通网络中实现了比传统方法更好的效率和拥堵缓解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有路径搜索算法和强化学习方法难以扩展到城市规模网络，无法有效处理城市交通的非线性、随机性和耦合动态特性。

Method: 提出分层LLM框架，包含全局交通分配代理协调区域间交通流分布，以及局部导航代理生成符合全局指令的局部自适应路线，采用双奖励结构的协同推理优化机制进行联合训练。

Result: 在四个真实道路网络（最大160万条道路和43万个交叉口）上的实验表明，CityNav在九种经典路径搜索和基于RL的基准方法中，在城市规模出行效率和拥堵缓解方面表现最优。

Conclusion: LLM有潜力实现可扩展、自适应和协同的城市范围交通导航，为复杂城市环境中的智能大规模车辆路由提供基础。

Abstract: The rise of Internet of Vehicles (IoV) technologies is transforming traffic
management from isolated control to a collective, multi-vehicle process. At the
heart of this shift is multi-vehicle dynamic navigation, which requires
simultaneously routing large fleets under evolving traffic conditions. Existing
path search algorithms and reinforcement learning methods struggle to scale to
city-wide networks, often failing to capture the nonlinear, stochastic, and
coupled dynamics of urban traffic. To address these challenges, we propose
CityNav, a hierarchical, LLM-powered framework for large-scale multi-vehicle
navigation. CityNav integrates a global traffic allocation agent, which
coordinates strategic traffic flow distribution across regions, with local
navigation agents that generate locally adaptive routes aligned with global
directives. To enable effective cooperation, we introduce a cooperative
reasoning optimization mechanism, in which agents are jointly trained with a
dual-reward structure: individual rewards promote per-vehicle efficiency, while
shared rewards encourage network-wide coordination and congestion reduction.
Extensive experiments on four real-world road networks of varying scales (up to
1.6 million roads and 430,000 intersections) and traffic datasets demonstrate
that CityNav consistently outperforms nine classical path search and RL-based
baselines in city-scale travel efficiency and congestion mitigation. Our
results highlight the potential of LLMs to enable scalable, adaptive, and
cooperative city-wide traffic navigation, providing a foundation for
intelligent, large-scale vehicle routing in complex urban environments. Our
project is available at https://github.com/usail-hkust/CityNav.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made substantial progress in
recent years. However, their rigorous evaluation within specialized domains
like finance is hindered by the absence of datasets characterized by
professional-level knowledge intensity, detailed annotations, and advanced
reasoning complexity. To address this critical gap, we introduce FinMR, a
high-quality, knowledge-intensive multimodal dataset explicitly designed to
evaluate expert-level financial reasoning capabilities at a professional
analyst's standard. FinMR comprises over 3,200 meticulously curated and
expertly annotated question-answer pairs across 15 diverse financial topics,
ensuring broad domain diversity and integrating sophisticated mathematical
reasoning, advanced financial knowledge, and nuanced visual interpretation
tasks across multiple image types. Through comprehensive benchmarking with
leading closed-source and open-source MLLMs, we highlight significant
performance disparities between these models and professional financial
analysts, uncovering key areas for model advancement, such as precise image
analysis, accurate application of complex financial formulas, and deeper
contextual financial understanding. By providing richly varied visual content
and thorough explanatory annotations, FinMR establishes itself as an essential
benchmark tool for assessing and advancing multimodal financial reasoning
toward professional analyst-level competence.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Augur是一个完全由大语言模型驱动的时序预测框架，利用LLM的因果推理能力发现变量间的有向因果关系，通过师生架构实现准确且可解释的预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的时序预测方法存在架构边缘化、依赖粗糙统计文本提示、缺乏可解释性等局限，需要开发更有效的LLM驱动框架。

Method: 采用两阶段师生架构：教师LLM通过启发式搜索和成对因果检验推断有向因果图；学生代理精炼因果图并基于高置信度因果关联进行微调预测。

Result: 在真实世界数据集上与25个基线方法对比，Augur展现出竞争性性能和强大的零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: Augur框架通过利用LLM的因果推理能力，在保持预测准确性的同时提供了透明可追溯的变量交互推理，为LLM在时序预测中的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large language models (LLM) have emerged as a promising avenue for time
series forecasting, offering the potential to integrate multimodal data.
However, existing LLM-based approaches face notable limitations-such as
marginalized role in model architectures, reliance on coarse statistical text
prompts, and lack of interpretability. In this work, we introduce Augur, a
fully LLM driven time series forecasting framework that exploits LLM causal
reasoning to discover and use directed causal associations among covariates.
Augur uses a two stage teacher student architecture where a powerful teacher
LLM infers a directed causal graph from time series using heuristic search
together with pairwise causality testing. A lightweight student agent then
refines the graph and fine tune on high confidence causal associations that are
encoded as rich textual prompts to perform forecasting. This design improves
predictive accuracy while yielding transparent, traceable reasoning about
variable interactions. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets with 25
baselines demonstrate that Augur achieves competitive performance and robust
zero-shot generalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试关注孤立能力而非整体性能，深度研究系统需要综合多种来源、生成见解并呈现连贯发现，这些能力难以简单验证。

Method: 引入DeepResearch-ReportEval框架，系统评估研究报告的质量、冗余性和事实性，采用创新的LLM-as-a-Judge方法，提供包含100个查询的标准化基准。

Result: 评估了四个领先商业系统，揭示了不同的设计理念和性能权衡，为深度研究从信息助手向智能研究伙伴演进提供了基础见解。

Conclusion: 该框架为评估深度研究系统提供了标准化方法，有助于推动该领域从信息助手向智能研究伙伴的发展。

Abstract: DeepResearch agents represent a transformative AI paradigm, conducting
expert-level research through sophisticated reasoning and multi-tool
integration. However, evaluating these systems remains critically challenging
due to open-ended research scenarios and existing benchmarks that focus on
isolated capabilities rather than holistic performance. Unlike traditional LLM
tasks, DeepResearch systems must synthesize diverse sources, generate insights,
and present coherent findings, which are capabilities that resist simple
verification. To address this gap, we introduce DeepResearch-ReportEval, a
comprehensive framework designed to assess DeepResearch systems through their
most representative outputs: research reports. Our approach systematically
measures three dimensions: quality, redundancy, and factuality, using an
innovative LLM-as-a-Judge methodology achieving strong expert concordance. We
contribute a standardized benchmark of 100 curated queries spanning 12
real-world categories, enabling systematic capability comparison. Our
evaluation of four leading commercial systems reveals distinct design
philosophies and performance trade-offs, establishing foundational insights as
DeepResearch evolves from information assistants toward intelligent research
partners. Source code and data are available at:

*Dave Murray-Rust,Kars Alfrink,Cristina Zaga*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了"有意义透明度"概念，旨在让公众能够理解和参与影响他们生活的AI系统，将理解与行动潜力联系起来。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI透明度实践主要关注技术对象，难以让公众理解，无法连接行动潜力，也无法洞察决策的广泛社会物质背景。

Method: 基于现有以人为中心的AI透明度方法，结合社会技术系统视角，发展公民AI系统的有意义透明度概念。

Result: 开发了有意义透明度的概念框架，强调透明度应让公众能够与影响他们生活的AI系统互动。

Conclusion: 有意义透明度是公民AI系统的关键原则，能够连接理解与行动潜力，增强公众对AI决策的参与能力。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence has become a part of the provision of governmental
services, from making decisions about benefits to issuing fines for parking
violations. However, AI systems rarely live up to the promise of neutral
optimisation, creating biased or incorrect outputs and reducing the agency of
both citizens and civic workers to shape the way decisions are made.
Transparency is a principle that can both help subjects understand decisions
made about them and shape the processes behind those decisions. However,
transparency as practiced around AI systems tends to focus on the production of
technical objects that represent algorithmic aspects of decision making. These
are often difficult for publics to understand, do not connect to potential for
action, and do not give insight into the wider socio-material context of
decision making. In this paper, we build on existing approaches that take a
human-centric view on AI transparency, combined with a socio-technical systems
view, to develop the concept of meaningful transparency for civic AI systems:
transparencies that allow publics to engage with AI systems that affect their
lives, connecting understanding with potential for action.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文揭示了LLM金融代理中的"利润幻象"问题，提出了FactFin框架来强制学习因果驱动因素而非记忆结果，并通过FinLake-Bench基准进行稳健评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM金融代理在回测中表现出色但在知识窗口结束后收益消失，存在信息泄露问题，需要系统量化并解决这一挑战。

Method: FactFin框架包含策略代码生成器、检索增强生成、蒙特卡洛树搜索和反事实模拟器四个核心组件，通过反事实扰动强制学习因果驱动因素。

Result: 广泛实验表明该方法在样本外泛化方面超越所有基线，提供优越的风险调整后性能。

Conclusion: FactFin框架有效缓解了LLM金融代理的信息泄露问题，提高了模型的稳健性和泛化能力。

Abstract: LLM-based financial agents have attracted widespread excitement for their
ability to trade like human experts. However, most systems exhibit a "profit
mirage": dazzling back-tested returns evaporate once the model's knowledge
window ends, because of the inherent information leakage in LLMs. In this
paper, we systematically quantify this leakage issue across four dimensions and
release FinLake-Bench, a leakage-robust evaluation benchmark. Furthermore, to
mitigate this issue, we introduce FactFin, a framework that applies
counterfactual perturbations to compel LLM-based agents to learn causal drivers
instead of memorized outcomes. FactFin integrates four core components:
Strategy Code Generator, Retrieval-Augmented Generation, Monte Carlo Tree
Search, and Counterfactual Simulator. Extensive experiments show that our
method surpasses all baselines in out-of-sample generalization, delivering
superior risk-adjusted performance.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一个集成持久记忆、动态协调、自我验证和演进用户档案的框架，用于实现基于LLM的个性化长期交互智能体。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM作为AI智能体控制单元的方法在提供个性化交互方面存在局限，RAG虽然提升了上下文感知但缺乏结合上下文信息与用户特定数据的机制。

Method: 基于统一个性化定义构建技术需求，结合多智能体协作和多源检索等成熟AI模式，集成持久记忆、动态协调、自我验证和演进用户档案。

Result: 在三个公共数据集上评估了检索准确性、响应正确性和BertScore，并通过5天试点用户研究获得了关于感知个性化的初步用户反馈。

Conclusion: 研究为未来工作提供了早期指导，并突显了集成持久记忆和用户档案在提升基于LLM智能体的适应性和感知个性化方面的潜力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly serve as the central control unit
of AI agents, yet current approaches remain limited in their ability to deliver
personalized interactions. While Retrieval Augmented Generation enhances LLM
capabilities by improving context-awareness, it lacks mechanisms to combine
contextual information with user-specific data. Although personalization has
been studied in fields such as human-computer interaction or cognitive science,
existing perspectives largely remain conceptual, with limited focus on
technical implementation. To address these gaps, we build on a unified
definition of personalization as a conceptual foundation to derive technical
requirements for adaptive, user-centered LLM-based agents. Combined with
established agentic AI patterns such as multi-agent collaboration or
multi-source retrieval, we present a framework that integrates persistent
memory, dynamic coordination, self-validation, and evolving user profiles to
enable personalized long-term interactions. We evaluate our approach on three
public datasets using metrics such as retrieval accuracy, response correctness,
or BertScore. We complement these results with a five-day pilot user study
providing initial insights into user feedback on perceived personalization. The
study provides early indications that guide future work and highlights the
potential of integrating persistent memory and user profiles to improve the
adaptivity and perceived personalization of LLM-based agents.

(CGA-Agent), a pioneering hybrid framework that synergistically integrates
genetic algorithms with intelligent multi-agent coordination mechanisms for

Motivation: 现有训练方法（SFT、DPO）在长尾查询上泛化能力差，缺乏细粒度步进监督；RLVR方法存在稀疏反馈问题，无法纠正错误的中间推理步骤。需要开发更可解释和鲁棒的相关性系统。

Method: TaoSR-SHE框架核心是步进奖励策略优化（SRPO），利用高质量生成式步进奖励模型和人工标注离线验证器生成的步级奖励，结合多样化数据过滤和多阶段课程学习技术。

Result: 在真实世界搜索基准测试中，TaoSR-SHE在推理质量和相关性预测准确性方面均优于SFT、DPO、GRPO等基线方法，同时增强了可解释性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: TaoSR-SHE框架通过步进式强化学习有效解决了现有方法的局限性，为电商搜索相关性分析提供了更优的解决方案，在复杂推理场景中表现出色。

Abstract: Query-product relevance analysis is a foundational technology in e-commerce
search engines and has become increasingly important in AI-driven e-commerce.
The recent emergence of large language models (LLMs), particularly their
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities, offers promising opportunities
for developing relevance systems that are both more interpretable and more
robust. However, existing training paradigms have notable limitations: SFT and
DPO suffer from poor generalization on long-tail queries and from a lack of
fine-grained, stepwise supervision to enforce rule-aligned reasoning. In
contrast, reinforcement learning with verification rewards (RLVR) suffers from
sparse feedback, which provides insufficient signal to correct erroneous
intermediate steps, thereby undermining logical consistency and limiting
performance in complex inference scenarios.
  To address these challenges, we introduce the Stepwise Hybrid Examination
Reinforcement Learning framework for Taobao Search Relevance (TaoSR-SHE). At
its core is Stepwise Reward Policy Optimization (SRPO), a reinforcement
learning algorithm that leverages step-level rewards generated by a hybrid of a
high-quality generative stepwise reward model and a human-annotated offline
verifier, prioritizing learning from critical correct and incorrect reasoning
steps. TaoSR-SHE further incorporates two key techniques: diversified data
filtering to encourage exploration across varied reasoning paths and mitigate
policy entropy collapse, and multi-stage curriculum learning to foster
progressive capability growth. Extensive experiments on real-world search
benchmarks show that TaoSR-SHE improves both reasoning quality and
relevance-prediction accuracy in large-scale e-commerce settings, outperforming
SFT, DPO, GRPO, and other baselines, while also enhancing interpretability and
robustness.

Abstract: Large-scale Speech Language Models (SpeechLMs) have enabled voice assistants
capable of understanding natural spoken queries and performing complex tasks.
However, existing speech benchmarks primarily focus on isolated capabilities
such as transcription, or question-answering, and do not systematically
evaluate agentic scenarios encompassing multilingual and cultural
understanding, as well as adversarial robustness. To address this, we introduce
VoiceAgentBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate SpeechLMs in
realistic spoken agentic settings. It comprises over 5,500 synthetic spoken
queries, including dialogues grounded in Indian context, covering single-tool
invocations, multi-tool workflows, multi-turn interactions, and safety
evaluations. The benchmark supports English, Hindi, and 5 other Indian
languages, reflecting real-world linguistic and cultural diversity. We simulate
speaker variability using a novel sampling algorithm that selects audios for
TTS voice conversion based on its speaker embeddings, maximizing acoustic and
speaker diversity. Our evaluation measures tool selection accuracy, structural
consistency, and the correctness of tool invocations, including adversarial
robustness. Our experiments reveal significant gaps in contextual tool
orchestration tasks, Indic generalization, and adversarial robustness, exposing
critical limitations of current SpeechLMs.

TL;DR: ReInAgent是一个上下文感知的多智能体框架，通过动态信息管理和人机协同来解决移动GUI代理在模糊、动态变化和冲突任务场景中的信息困境问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的移动GUI代理过于强调自主操作，忽视了用户在任务执行过程中的主动参与需求，导致在信息困境场景下无法适应真实用户需求和偏好。

Method: 提出了ReInAgent框架，包含三个专门智能体：信息管理智能体（负责基于槽位的信息管理和主动用户交互）、决策智能体（负责冲突感知规划）和反思智能体（负责任务反思和信息一致性验证），围绕共享内存模块协同工作。

Result: 实验结果表明，ReInAgent能有效解决信息困境，产生更符合用户偏好的结果。在涉及信息困境的复杂任务上，比Mobile-Agent-v2成功率高出25%。

Conclusion: 通过持续上下文信息分析和持续的人机协作，ReInAgent克服了现有方法依赖清晰静态任务假设的局限性，实现了在复杂现实场景中更自适应和可靠的移动任务导航。

Abstract: Mobile GUI agents exhibit substantial potential to facilitate and automate
the execution of user tasks on mobile phones. However, exist mobile GUI agents
predominantly privilege autonomous operation and neglect the necessity of
active user engagement during task execution. This omission undermines their
adaptability to information dilemmas including ambiguous, dynamically evolving,
and conflicting task scenarios, leading to execution outcomes that deviate from
genuine user requirements and preferences. To address these shortcomings, we
propose ReInAgent, a context-aware multi-agent framework that leverages dynamic
information management to enable human-in-the-loop mobile task navigation.
ReInAgent integrates three specialized agents around a shared memory module: an
information-managing agent for slot-based information management and proactive
interaction with the user, a decision-making agent for conflict-aware planning,
and a reflecting agent for task reflection and information consistency
validation. Through continuous contextual information analysis and sustained
user-agent collaboration, ReInAgent overcomes the limitation of existing
approaches that rely on clear and static task assumptions. Consequently, it
enables more adaptive and reliable mobile task navigation in complex,
real-world scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that ReInAgent
effectively resolves information dilemmas and produces outcomes that are more
closely aligned with genuine user preferences. Notably, on complex tasks
involving information dilemmas, ReInAgent achieves a 25% higher success rate
than Mobile-Agent-v2.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索语言模型是否真正将连续值建模为连续，以及它们在数值表示中的表现特性。

Method: 使用线性重建和主成分分析评估三个主要提供商（OpenAI、Google Gemini和Voyage AI）的语言模型嵌入空间特性。

Result: 虽然重建精度高（R²≥0.95），但主成分仅解释少量方差，且随着小数精度增加，线性重建和解释方差都变差。

Conclusion: 语言模型在数值表示中存在非连续性和噪声问题，这对需要高数值精度、大数值范围或混合符号值的应用领域有重要影响。

Abstract: Recent research has extensively studied how large language models manipulate
integers in specific arithmetic tasks, and on a more fundamental level, how
they represent numeric values. These previous works have found that language
model embeddings can be used to reconstruct the original values, however, they
do not evaluate whether language models actually model continuous values as
continuous. Using expected properties of the embedding space, including linear
reconstruction and principal component analysis, we show that language models
not only represent numeric spaces as non-continuous but also introduce
significant noise. Using models from three major providers (OpenAI, Google
Gemini and Voyage AI), we show that while reconstruction is possible with high
fidelity ($R^2 \geq 0.95$), principal components only explain a minor share of
variation within the embedding space. This indicates that many components
within the embedding space are orthogonal to the simple numeric input space.
Further, both linear reconstruction and explained variance suffer with
increasing decimal precision, despite the ordinal nature of the input space
being fundamentally unchanged. The findings of this work therefore have
implications for the many areas where embedding models are used, in-particular
where high numerical precision, large magnitudes or mixed-sign values are
common.

*Chen Huang,Wei Lu,Wenxuan Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PEAR是一种基于阶段熵感知的奖励机制，通过在不同推理阶段施加不同的熵约束来控制大推理模型的响应长度，在保持准确性的同时显著减少冗余推理步骤。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大推理模型生成的推理链往往过长且包含冗余步骤，这会增加推理成本并降低可用性。如何在保持准确性的同时控制生成推理的长度是一个未解决的挑战。

Method: 提出PEAR奖励机制，在思维阶段惩罚过高的熵以鼓励简洁推理，在最终答案阶段允许适度的探索灵活性，从而自适应地控制响应长度。

Result: 在四个基准测试上的广泛实验表明，PEAR能持续减少响应长度，同时在不同模型规模下保持竞争力的准确性，并展现出超出训练分布的强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 基于推理阶段熵的奖励设计能有效平衡简洁性和性能，为控制大推理模型的响应长度提供了一种无需显式长度目标的自适应方法。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved impressive performance on complex
reasoning tasks by generating detailed chain-of-thought (CoT) explanations.
However, these responses are often excessively long, containing redundant
reasoning steps that inflate inference cost and reduce usability. Controlling
the length of generated reasoning without sacrificing accuracy remains an open
challenge. Through a systematic empirical analysis, we reveal a consistent
positive correlation between model entropy and response length at different
reasoning stages across diverse LRMs: the thinking phase exhibits higher
entropy, reflecting exploratory behavior of longer responses, while the final
answer phase shows lower entropy, indicating a more deterministic solution.This
observation suggests that entropy at different reasoning stages can serve as a
control knob for balancing conciseness and performance. Based on this insight,
this paper introduces Phase Entropy Aware Reward (PEAR), a reward mechanism
that incorporating phase-dependent entropy into the reward design. Instead of
treating all tokens uniformly, PEAR penalize excessive entropy during the
thinking phase and allowing moderate exploration at the final answer phase,
which encourages models to generate concise reasoning traces that retain
sufficient flexibility to solve the task correctly. This enables adaptive
control of response length without relying on explicit length targets or rigid
truncation rules. Extensive experiments across four benchmarks demonstrate that
PEAR consistently reduces response length while sustaining competitive accuracy
across model scales. In addition, PEAR demonstrates strong out-of-distribution
(OOD) robustness beyond the training distribution. Our code is available at:

### [42] [AILoRA: Function-Aware Asymmetric Initialization for Low-Rank Adaptation of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08034)
*Xiaoshuang Ji,Zhendong Zhao,Xiaoyan Gu,Xiaojun Chen,Xin Zhao,Zeyao Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出AILoRA方法，通过函数感知的非对称低秩先验改进LoRA，针对自注意力机制中W^Q和W^V矩阵的不同功能特性进行差异化初始化，提升微调性能和收敛效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LoRA虽然被广泛采用，但仍面临性能次优和收敛缓慢的问题。研究发现自注意力机制中的W^Q和W^V矩阵具有不同的参数特性，W^Q对下游任务变化敏感，而W^V的特征表示在不同任务和层间保持稳定。

Method: AILoRA采用函数感知的非对称初始化策略：为W^Q注入主成分以保留任务适应能力，为W^V注入次要成分以保持通用特征表示。这种差异化处理能更好地捕捉注意力参数的专业化角色。

Result: 该方法能够增强微调性能和收敛效率，使LoRA模块更好地适应注意力参数的不同功能特性。

Conclusion: 通过考虑自注意力机制中不同投影矩阵的功能差异，AILoRA提供了一种更有效的参数高效微调方法，解决了传统LoRA的性能限制。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient finetuning (PEFT) aims to mitigate the substantial
computational and memory overhead involved in adapting large-scale pretrained
models to diverse downstream tasks. Among numerous PEFT strategies, Low-Rank
Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as one of the most widely adopted approaches due
to its robust empirical performance and low implementation complexity. In
practical deployment, LoRA is typically applied to the $W^Q$ and $W^V$
projection matrices of self-attention modules, enabling an effective trade-off
between model performance and parameter efficiency. While LoRA has achieved
considerable empirical success, it still encounters challenges such as
suboptimal performance and slow convergence. To address these limitations, we
introduce \textbf{AILoRA}, a novel parameter-efficient method that incorporates
function-aware asymmetric low-rank priors. Our empirical analysis reveals that
the projection matrices $W^Q$ and $W^V$ in the self-attention mechanism exhibit
distinct parameter characteristics, stemming from their functional differences.
Specifically, $W^Q$ captures task-specific semantic space knowledge essential
for attention distributions computation, making its parameters highly sensitive
to downstream task variations. In contrast, $W^V$ encodes token-level feature
representations that tend to remain stable across tasks and layers. Leveraging
these insights, AILoRA performs a function-aware initialization by injecting
the principal components of $W^Q$ to retain task-adaptive capacity, and the
minor components of $W^V$ to preserve generalizable feature representations.
This asymmetric initialization strategy enables LoRA modules to better capture
the specialized roles of attention parameters, thereby enhancing both
finetuning performance and convergence efficiency.

*Qingyuan Shi,Qingwen Meng,Hao Cheng,Qing Xu,Jianqiang Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LinguaSim是一个基于LLM的框架，能将自然语言转换为真实、交互式的3D自动驾驶测试场景，确保车辆动态交互和输入描述的准确对齐，通过反馈校准模块提高生成精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的场景生成方法难以平衡命令准确性和现实性，常因简化场景描述而牺牲真实性，局限于2D或非交互式仿真。

Method: 提出LinguaSim框架，包含反馈校准模块，通过自然语言生成交互式3D场景，约束对抗性车辆行为，确保闭环仿真。

Result: 实验显示LinguaSim能生成不同危险程度的场景（危险场景ACT: 0.072s vs 安全场景3.532s），校准模块将碰撞率从46.9%降至6.3%。

Conclusion: LinguaSim弥合了自然语言与闭环交互仿真之间的差距，为安全测试和训练创建高保真场景。

Abstract: The generation of testing and training scenarios for autonomous vehicles has
drawn significant attention. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled
new scenario generation methods, current methods struggle to balance command
adherence accuracy with the realism of real-world driving environments. To
reduce scenario description complexity, these methods often compromise realism
by limiting scenarios to 2D, or open-loop simulations where background vehicles
follow predefined, non-interactive behaviors. We propose LinguaSim, an
LLM-based framework that converts natural language into realistic, interactive
3D scenarios, ensuring both dynamic vehicle interactions and faithful alignment
between the input descriptions and the generated scenarios. A feedback
calibration module further refines the generation precision, improving fidelity
to user intent. By bridging the gap between natural language and closed-loop,
interactive simulations, LinguaSim constrains adversarial vehicle behaviors
using both the scenario description and the autonomous driving model guiding
them. This framework facilitates the creation of high-fidelity scenarios that
enhance safety testing and training. Experiments show LinguaSim can generate
scenarios with varying criticality aligned with different natural language
descriptions (ACT: 0.072 s for dangerous vs. 3.532 s for safe descriptions;
comfortability: 0.654 vs. 0.764), and its refinement module effectively reduces
excessive aggressiveness in LinguaSim's initial outputs, lowering the crash
rate from 46.9% to 6.3% to better match user intentions.

*Qingyang Hao,Wenbo Liao,Bingyi Jing,Hongxin Wei*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了多条件符合选择（MCCS）算法，将符合选择扩展到多条件场景，包括合取和析取条件，实现了有限样本FDR控制的理论保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在药物发现、精准医学和大语言模型对齐等资源受限应用中，从大规模数据集中选择高质量候选者至关重要。现有符合选择方法仅适用于单阈值场景，无法满足多条件选择的实际需求。

Method: 提出了MCCS算法，为合取条件引入了具有区域单调性的新非符合性评分，为析取条件引入了全局Benjamini-Hochberg（BH）程序。

Result: 广泛的实验验证了MCCS相对于基线的优越性，其在多样化条件组合、不同现实世界模态和多任务可扩展性方面的泛化能力。

Conclusion: MCCS算法能够在各种多条件环境中实现严格的FDR控制选择，解决了现有方法在多条件场景下的局限性。

Abstract: Selecting high-quality candidates from large-scale datasets is critically
important in resource-constrained applications such as drug discovery,
precision medicine, and the alignment of large language models. While conformal
selection methods offer a rigorous solution with False Discovery Rate (FDR)
control, their applicability is confined to single-threshold scenarios (i.e., y
> c) and overlooks practical needs for multi-condition selection, such as
conjunctive or disjunctive conditions. In this work, we propose the
Multi-Condition Conformal Selection (MCCS) algorithm, which extends conformal
selection to scenarios with multiple conditions. In particular, we introduce a
novel nonconformity score with regional monotonicity for conjunctive conditions
and a global Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) procedure for disjunctive conditions,
thereby establishing finite-sample FDR control with theoretical guarantees. The
integration of these components enables the proposed method to achieve rigorous
FDR-controlled selection in various multi-condition environments. Extensive
experiments validate the superiority of MCCS over baselines, its
generalizability across diverse condition combinations, different real-world
modalities, and multi-task scalability.

*Xiaochong Lan,Jie Feng,Yinxing Liu,Xinlei Shi,Yong Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AutoQual是一个基于LLM的代理框架，用于自动发现可解释特征，在评论质量评估任务中验证了其有效性，能够提升用户体验和转化率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线评论质量评估对电商平台至关重要，但质量评估具有领域依赖性和动态性。传统方法难以跨领域扩展且无法适应内容模式变化，而深度学习方法缺乏可解释性且可能过度关注语义而非质量。

Method: AutoQual框架模仿人类研究过程，通过反思迭代生成特征假设，通过自主工具实现操作化，并在持久内存中积累经验，将数据中的隐性知识转化为显性可计算特征。

Result: 在拥有十亿级用户的大型在线平台上部署，A/B测试显示平均每位用户查看评论数增加0.79%，评论读者转化率提升0.27%。

Conclusion: AutoQual成功解决了评论质量评估的可扩展性、适应性和可解释性问题，证明了将隐性知识转化为显性特征的通用框架的有效性。

Abstract: Ranking online reviews by their intrinsic quality is a critical task for
e-commerce platforms and information services, impacting user experience and
business outcomes. However, quality is a domain-dependent and dynamic concept,
making its assessment a formidable challenge. Traditional methods relying on
hand-crafted features are unscalable across domains and fail to adapt to
evolving content patterns, while modern deep learning approaches often produce
black-box models that lack interpretability and may prioritize semantics over
quality. To address these challenges, we propose AutoQual, an LLM-based agent
framework that automates the discovery of interpretable features. While
demonstrated on review quality assessment, AutoQual is designed as a general
framework for transforming tacit knowledge embedded in data into explicit,
computable features. It mimics a human research process, iteratively generating
feature hypotheses through reflection, operationalizing them via autonomous
tool implementation, and accumulating experience in a persistent memory. We
deploy our method on a large-scale online platform with a billion-level user
base. Large-scale A/B testing confirms its effectiveness, increasing average
reviews viewed per user by 0.79% and the conversion rate of review readers by
0.27%.

### [46] [From Ethical Declarations to Provable Independence: An Ontology-Driven Optimal-Transport Framework for Certifiably Fair AI Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08086)
*Sukriti Bhattacharya,Chitro Majumdar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一个可证明公平的AI框架，通过系统性地移除所有敏感信息及其代理，使用OWL 2 QL本体工程构建sigma代数G来捕获偏见模式结构，然后通过Delbaen Majumdar最优传输获得公平表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 克服当前偏见缓解方法的局限性，确保AI系统的完全公平性，特别是在敏感属性通过代理变量（如邮政编码揭示种族）泄露的情况下。

Method: 使用OWL 2 QL本体工程形式化定义敏感属性并通过逻辑推理推断其代理，构建sigma代数G捕获偏见模式结构，然后应用Delbaen Majumdar最优传输生成与G独立的公平表示。

Result: 该方法保证了真正的独立性而非仅仅去相关，在贷款审批等任务中确保完全公平，提供可认证和数学基础的方法。

Conclusion: 该框架通过将偏见建模为sigma代数间的依赖关系，将本体知识编译为可测量结构，并使用最优传输作为唯一的公平变换，实现了可信AI的数学基础保障。

Abstract: This paper presents a framework for provably fair AI that overcomes the
limits of current bias mitigation methods by systematically removing all
sensitive information and its proxies. Using ontology engineering in OWL 2 QL,
it formally defines sensitive attributes and infers their proxies through
logical reasoning, constructing a sigma algebra G that captures the full
structure of biased patterns. Fair representations are then obtained via
Delbaen Majumdar optimal transport, which generates variables independent of G
while minimizing L2 distance to preserve accuracy. This guarantees true
independence rather than mere decorrelation. By modeling bias as dependence
between sigma algebras, compiling ontological knowledge into measurable
structures, and using optimal transport as the unique fair transformation, the
approach ensures complete fairness in tasks like loan approval, where proxies
such as ZIP code reveal race. The result is a certifiable and mathematically
grounded method for trustworthy AI.

TL;DR: 研究语言模型风险规避的可操纵性，发现虽然某些模型与人类行为有一定对齐，但仍存在显著差异，需要改进生物中心的可操纵性测量方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着语言模型越来越多地融入AI驱动的决策支持系统，理解它们的风险行为对于负责任部署至关重要，需要防止无意中引导用户做出风险决策或嵌入隐藏偏见。

Method: 研究语言模型风险规避的可操纵性，考察它们在多样化经济场景中复制人类风险偏好的能力，重点关注性别特定态度、不确定性、基于角色的决策和风险规避的可操纵性。

Result: DeepSeek Reasoner和Gemini-2.0-flash-lite等语言模型表现出与人类行为的一定对齐，但存在显著差异，突显了改进生物中心可操纵性测量的必要性。

Conclusion: 需要进一步改进模型设计，确保AI系统更准确地复制人类风险偏好，从而在风险管理环境中提高其有效性，增强AI助手在风险管理中的适用性。

Abstract: Responsible AI demands systems whose behavioral tendencies can be effectively
measured, audited, and adjusted to prevent inadvertently nudging users toward
risky decisions or embedding hidden biases in risk aversion. As language models
(LMs) are increasingly incorporated into AI-driven decision support systems,
understanding their risk behaviors is crucial for their responsible deployment.
This study investigates the manipulability of risk aversion (MoRA) in LMs,
examining their ability to replicate human risk preferences across diverse
economic scenarios, with a focus on gender-specific attitudes, uncertainty,
role-based decision-making, and the manipulability of risk aversion. The
results indicate that while LMs such as DeepSeek Reasoner and
Gemini-2.0-flash-lite exhibit some alignment with human behaviors, notable
discrepancies highlight the need to refine bio-centric measures of
manipulability. These findings suggest directions for refining AI design to
better align human and AI risk preferences and enhance ethical decision-making.
The study calls for further advancements in model design to ensure that AI
systems more accurately replicate human risk preferences, thereby improving
their effectiveness in risk management contexts. This approach could enhance
the applicability of AI assistants in managing risk.

*Jinling Gan,Churong Liang,Runnan Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PMFR提出了一种异步知识编排框架，通过在对话系统中解耦知识检索和响应生成来解决延迟与质量的权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开放域对话系统中存在延迟与质量的根本矛盾：轻量级模型响应快但缺乏推理深度，而工具增强的ReAct代理虽然准确性高但同步执行导致交互阻塞。

Method: PMFR采用三组件架构：知识充足性评估器（实时评估）、轻量级响应生成器（即时交互）和异步知识精炼代理（后台知识增强），通过智能触发机制实现异步知识编排。

Result: 在Top-iOCQA上的评估显示，PMFR实现了95.3%的延迟降低（从23.38秒降至1.09秒），同时保持与重量级同步基线相当的响应质量（GEval-C: 0.613 vs. 0.620）。

Conclusion: PMFR通过时间解耦框架成功解决了对话系统中的延迟-质量权衡问题，在显著降低延迟的同时保持了高质量的响应能力。

Abstract: The latency-quality tradeoff is a fundamental constraint in open-domain
dialogue AI systems, since comprehensive knowledge access necessitates
prohibitive response delays. Contemporary approaches offer two inadequate
solutions: lightweight instruct models achieve sub-second latency but lack
reasoning depth, while tool-augmented ReAct agents enhance factuality through
external knowledge at the cost of synchronous execution that blocks interaction
during re- trieval processes. PMFR is thus proposed, with a tempo- ral
decoupling framework that fundamentally resolves the contradiction through
asynchronous knowledge orchestra- tion. PMFR employs three coordinated
components: (1) a Knowledge Adequacy Evaluator for real-time sufficiency
assessment, (2) a Lightweight Response Generator for imme- diate user
interaction, and (3) an Asynchronous Knowledge Refinement Agent for background
knowledge enhancement. This architecture maintains continuous conversational
flow while progressively enriching knowledge coverage through intelligent
triggering mechanisms. Evaluation results on Top- iOCQA demonstrate PMFR
outperforms brute-force scaling: PMFR achieves 95.3% latency reduction (23.38s
-> 1.09s) while preserving response quality comparable to heavyweight
synchronous baselines (GEval-C: 0.613 vs. 0.620).

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了R-HORIZON方法来评估和增强大型推理模型的长视野推理能力，通过查询组合构建多步骤推理任务，发现现有模型在长视野推理中表现显著下降，并利用该数据通过强化学习提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要关注即时单视野任务，无法充分评估模型理解和响应复杂长视野场景的能力，需要更全面的评估方法来测试大型推理模型的长视野推理能力。

Method: 提出R-HORIZON方法，通过查询组合刺激长视野推理行为，构建包含相互依赖问题的复杂多步骤推理任务的长视野推理基准，并利用该数据通过验证奖励的强化学习（RLVR）进行训练。

Result: 评估发现最先进的大型推理模型在长视野推理中性能显著下降，模型表现出有限的有效推理长度和跨问题思考预算分配困难。使用R-HORIZON数据进行RLVR训练不仅大幅提升多视野推理任务性能，还在标准推理任务上提高7.5个AIME2024分数。

Conclusion: R-HORIZON为增强和评估大型推理模型的长视野推理能力提供了一个可扩展、可控且低成本的范式。

Abstract: Recent trends in test-time scaling for reasoning models (e.g., OpenAI o1,
DeepSeek-R1) have led to remarkable improvements through long Chain-of-Thought
(CoT). However, existing benchmarks mainly focus on immediate, single-horizon
tasks, failing to adequately evaluate models' ability to understand and respond
to complex, long-horizon scenarios. To address this incomplete evaluation of
Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), we propose R-HORIZON, a method designed to
stimulate long-horizon reasoning behaviors in LRMs through query composition.
Based on R-HORIZON, we construct a long-horizon reasoning benchmark, comprising
complex multi-step reasoning tasks with interdependent problems that span long
reasoning horizons. Through comprehensive evaluation of LRMs using the
R-HORIZON benchmark, we find that even the most advanced LRMs suffer
significant performance degradation. Our analysis reveals that LRMs exhibit
limited effective reasoning length and struggle to allocate thinking budget
across multiple problems appropriately. Recognizing these limitations, we use
R-HORIZON to construct long-horizon reasoning data for reinforcement learning
with verified rewards (RLVR). Compared to training with single-horizon data,
RLVR with R-HORIZON not only substantially improves performance on the
multi-horizon reasoning tasks, but also promotes accuracy on standard reasoning
tasks, with an increase of 7.5 on AIME2024. These results position R-HORIZON as
a scalable, controllable, and low-cost paradigm for enhancing and evaluating
the long-horizon reasoning capabilities of LRMs.

*Rashid Mushkani*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了AI多元主义指数(AIPI)，这是一个评估AI系统多元治理的透明、基于证据的测量工具，涵盖参与式治理、包容性与多样性、透明度和问责制四个支柱。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI开发和治理集中在少数公司和国家手中，可能导致技术编码狭隘利益并限制公众参与。缺乏可公开审计的多元治理衡量标准。

Method: 开发了AIPI测量模型，通过可复现的流程整合结构化网络和存储库分析、外部评估和专家访谈，处理'未知'证据，报告下限和已知分数。

Result: 报告了试点提供商结果，将AIPI与邻近的透明度、安全和治理框架进行对比。

Conclusion: 该指数旨在引导激励措施转向多元实践，为政策制定者、采购者和公众提供可比较的证据。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence systems increasingly mediate knowledge,
communication, and decision making. Development and governance remain
concentrated within a small set of firms and states, raising concerns that
technologies may encode narrow interests and limit public agency. Capability
benchmarks for language, vision, and coding are common, yet public, auditable
measures of pluralistic governance are rare. We define AI pluralism as the
degree to which affected stakeholders can shape objectives, data practices,
safeguards, and deployment. We present the AI Pluralism Index (AIPI), a
transparent, evidence-based instrument that evaluates producers and system
families across four pillars: participatory governance, inclusivity and
diversity, transparency, and accountability. AIPI codes verifiable practices
from public artifacts and independent evaluations, explicitly handling
"Unknown" evidence to report both lower-bound ("evidence") and known-only
scores with coverage. We formalize the measurement model; implement a
reproducible pipeline that integrates structured web and repository analysis,
external assessments, and expert interviews; and assess reliability with
inter-rater agreement, coverage reporting, cross-index correlations, and
sensitivity analysis. The protocol, codebook, scoring scripts, and evidence
graph are maintained openly with versioned releases and a public adjudication
process. We report pilot provider results and situate AIPI relative to adjacent
transparency, safety, and governance frameworks. The index aims to steer
incentives toward pluralistic practice and to equip policymakers, procurers,
and the public with comparable evidence.

*Diego García-Zamora,Álvaro Labella,José Rui Figueira*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了锦标赛树方法(TTM)，一种新的偏好获取和评估框架，仅需m-1次两两比较即可获得完整、互反且一致的比较矩阵，显著降低认知负担和计算复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统两两比较方法需要m(m-1)/2次比较，认知负担重，存在不一致风险，且计算复杂度高，限制了在多准则决策中的应用。

Method: TTM方法包含三个阶段：(i)使用减少的目标比较集获取专家判断，(ii)构建一致的两两比较矩阵，(iii)从结果矩阵推导全局价值尺度。该方法通过设计确保一致性，将偏好建模维度从m(m-1)/2降至m个参数。

Result: TTM方法能够获得完整、互反且一致的比较矩阵，与经典卡片法兼容，可处理区间和比率尺度，并开发了基于web的工具展示其实际应用性。

Conclusion: 锦标赛树方法通过减少比较次数、确保一致性和降低认知负担，有效克服了传统两两比较方法的局限性，为多准则决策提供了更实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Pairwise comparison methods, such as Fuzzy Preference Relations and Saaty's
Multiplicative Preference Relations, are widely used to model expert judgments
in multi-criteria decision-making. However, their application is limited by the
high cognitive load required to complete $m(m-1)/2$ comparisons, the risk of
inconsistency, and the computational complexity of deriving consistent value
scales. This paper proposes the Tournament Tree Method (TTM), a novel
elicitation and evaluation framework that overcomes these limitations. The TTM
requires only $m-1$ pairwise comparisons to obtain a complete, reciprocal, and
consistent comparison matrix. The method consists of three phases: (i)
elicitation of expert judgments using a reduced set of targeted comparisons,
(ii) construction of the consistent pairwise comparison matrix, and (iii)
derivation of a global value scale from the resulting matrix. The proposed
approach ensures consistency by design, minimizes cognitive effort, and reduces
the dimensionality of preference modeling from $m(m-1)/2$ to $m$ parameters.
Furthermore, it is compatible with the classical Deck of Cards method, and thus
it can handle interval and ratio scales. We have also developed a web-based
tool that demonstrates its practical applicability in real decision-making
scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI主要依赖复杂相关性，引入因果意识能增强AI对环境机制的理解，提升性能。

Method: 智能体在隐藏因果DAG的环境中通过重复干预，利用因果推断技术分析观测变化的统计显著性来推断因果结构。

Result: DODO在除最有限资源条件外的所有情况下优于观测方法，常能以接近零误差重建因果图结构，在最挑战配置中比最佳基线高0.25 F1分。

Conclusion: DODO算法能有效学习环境因果结构，为AI因果意识发展提供了有前景的方法。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence has achieved remarkable advancements in recent years,
yet much of its progress relies on identifying increasingly complex
correlations. Enabling causality awareness in AI has the potential to enhance
its performance by enabling a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms
of the environment. In this paper, we introduce DODO, an algorithm defining how
an Agent can autonomously learn the causal structure of its environment through
repeated interventions. We assume a scenario where an Agent interacts with a
world governed by a causal Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), which dictates the
system's dynamics but remains hidden from the Agent. The Agent's task is to
accurately infer the causal DAG, even in the presence of noise. To achieve
this, the Agent performs interventions, leveraging causal inference techniques
to analyze the statistical significance of observed changes. Results show
better performance for DODO, compared to observational approaches, in all but
the most limited resource conditions. DODO is often able to reconstruct with as
low as zero errors the structure of the causal graph. In the most challenging
configuration, DODO outperforms the best baseline by +0.25 F1 points.

Result: 实验表明该方法在推理准确性方面带来显著提升，例如在数独和迷宫任务上，相比最新进展，使用8倍更少的参数实现了超过10%的性能改进。

Conclusion: 从因果视角将推理任务建模为选择机制，并通过SR²框架整合潜在变量反馈，能够有效提升模型在复杂推理任务上的性能，为解决推理挑战提供了新的思路。

Abstract: Due to their inherent complexity, reasoning tasks have long been regarded as
rigorous benchmarks for assessing the capabilities of machine learning models,
especially large language models (LLMs). Although humans can solve these tasks
with ease, existing models, even after extensive pre-training and post-training
at scale, still fail to perform reasoning reliably. In this paper, we revisit
reasoning tasks from a causal perspective, seeking to understand their behavior
in latent space and to offer insights for addressing their challenges.
Specifically, we cast reasoning tasks as a selection mechanism, in which
high-level logical concepts function as selection operators on the given
observations, such as, identifying the correct answer in a math problem or
filling the appropriate entry in Sudoku. We emphasize two key properties of
this formulation that shed light on the difficulty of reasoning tasks. First,
the latent space exceeds the observation space in complexity, even when the
correct answer is fully determined by the observed input. Second, the latent
variables, corresponding to logical thought, are densely structured and exhibit
strong dependencies. Building on this formulation, we introduce a framework,
called SR$^2$, that incorporates the estimated latent variables as feedback
into the selection mechanism, thereby facilitating the learning of dense
dependencies among latent representations. The framework consists of three key
modules: reflective representation learning, dependency self-refinement, and
periodic intermediate alignment. Experimentally, we show that our approach
yields significant gains in reasoning accuracy, for example, attaining over
10$\%$ improvement in performance with 8$\times$ fewer parameters on the Sudoku
and Maze tasks over the recent advances.

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对LLM智能体的多步后门攻击方法CoTri，通过有序触发序列实现长期控制，攻击成功率接近完美，同时意外提升了智能体在良性任务上的表现和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着基于大语言模型的智能体在现实应用中的快速部署，其安全性和鲁棒性漏洞引发了严重担忧，需要揭示这些智能体的安全脆弱性。

Method: CoTri采用链式触发后门攻击，通过初始触发器和从环境中提取的后续触发器序列，实现多步操纵，使智能体偏离预定任务。

Result: 实验显示CoTri达到接近完美的攻击成功率，同时保持接近零的误触发率。由于训练数据建模了环境的随机性，植入CoTri反而提升了智能体在良性任务上的性能和对环境干扰的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: CoTri实现了智能体内稳定、多步的控制，同时增强了其固有鲁棒性和任务能力，这使得攻击更加隐蔽，带来了潜在的安全风险。

Abstract: The rapid deployment of large language model (LLM)-based agents in real-world
applications has raised serious concerns about their trustworthiness. In this
work, we reveal the security and robustness vulnerabilities of these agents
through backdoor attacks. Distinct from traditional backdoors limited to
single-step control, we propose the Chain-of-Trigger Backdoor (CoTri), a
multi-step backdoor attack designed for long-horizon agentic control. CoTri
relies on an ordered sequence. It starts with an initial trigger, and
subsequent ones are drawn from the environment, allowing multi-step
manipulation that diverts the agent from its intended task. Experimental
results show that CoTri achieves a near-perfect attack success rate (ASR) while
maintaining a near-zero false trigger rate (FTR). Due to training data modeling
the stochastic nature of the environment, the implantation of CoTri
paradoxically enhances the agent's performance on benign tasks and even
improves its robustness against environmental distractions. We further validate
CoTri on vision-language models (VLMs), confirming its scalability to
multimodal agents. Our work highlights that CoTri achieves stable, multi-step
control within agents, improving their inherent robustness and task

Abstract: This paper proposes Co-TAP (T: Triple, A: Agent, P: Protocol), a three-layer
agent interaction protocol designed to address the challenges faced by
multi-agent systems across the three core dimensions of Interoperability,
Interaction and Collaboration, and Knowledge Sharing. We have designed and
proposed a layered solution composed of three core protocols: the Human-Agent
Interaction Protocol (HAI), the Unified Agent Protocol (UAP), and the
Memory-Extraction-Knowledge Protocol (MEK). HAI focuses on the interaction
layer, standardizing the flow of information between users, interfaces, and
agents by defining a standardized, event-driven communication paradigm. This
ensures the real-time performance, reliability, and synergy of interactions. As
the core of the infrastructure layer, UAP is designed to break down
communication barriers among heterogeneous agents through unified service
discovery and protocol conversion mechanisms, thereby enabling seamless
interconnection and interoperability of the underlying network. MEK, in turn,
operates at the cognitive layer. By establishing a standardized ''Memory (M) -
Extraction (E) - Knowledge (K)'' cognitive chain, it empowers agents with the
ability to learn from individual experiences and form shareable knowledge,
thereby laying the foundation for the realization of true collective
intelligence. We believe this protocol framework will provide a solid
engineering foundation and theoretical guidance for building the next
generation of efficient, scalable, and intelligent multi-agent applications.

Result: 实证证明了该方法的有效性，理论分析显示CNN的尺度对称性规范自由度小于MLP，解释了性能差异。

Conclusion: 对称感知元网络是高效且可泛化的神经网络优化的强大方法，具有重要潜力。

Abstract: Amortized optimization accelerates the solution of related optimization
problems by learning mappings that exploit shared structure across problem
instances. We explore the use of Scale Equivariant Graph Metanetworks
(ScaleGMNs) for this purpose. By operating directly in weight space, ScaleGMNs
enable single-shot fine-tuning of existing models, reducing the need for
iterative optimization. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach
empirically and provide a theoretical result: the gauge freedom induced by
scaling symmetries is strictly smaller in convolutional neural networks than in
multi-layer perceptrons. This insight helps explain the performance differences
observed between architectures in both our work and that of Kalogeropoulos et
al. (2024). Overall, our findings underscore the potential of symmetry-aware
metanetworks as a powerful approach for efficient and generalizable neural
network optimization. Open-source code:

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文分析了大语言模型在推理过程中的反思行为，发现反思主要是确认性的，很少改变初始答案。通过训练实验表明，增加反思步骤主要提升首次回答正确率，而非通过反思修正错误的能力。作者提出了基于候选答案的早期停止方法，显著减少推理token使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大语言模型中反思行为对推理性能的实际贡献，探索反思在训练和推理中的真正作用，并寻求提高推理效率的方法。

Method: 系统分析8个推理模型在5个数学数据集上的推理过程；构建不同反思步骤的SFT数据集进行训练实验；提出基于候选答案的早期停止方法，动态截断不必要的反思步骤。

Result: 反思主要是确认性的，很少改变初始答案；增加反思步骤训练主要提升首次回答正确率；提出的早期停止方法减少24.5%的推理token，准确率仅下降2.9%。

Conclusion: 大语言模型的反思行为对修正错误答案的作用有限，主要功能是确认初始答案。通过动态截断反思步骤可以显著提高推理效率，同时保持较高的准确性。

Abstract: Large language models have recently demonstrated significant gains in
reasoning ability, often attributed to their capacity to generate longer chains
of thought and engage in reflective reasoning. However, the contribution of
reflections to performance improvement remains unclear. In this paper, we
systematically analyze the rollouts of eight reasoning models on five
mathematical datasets. We focus on reflective behaviours where the model has
already produced an answer but continues reflecting before finalizing its
output. Our analysis reveals that reflections are predominantly confirmatory
and rarely alter the model's initial answer, a pattern consistent across models
and datasets. To understand the role of reflections in training, we construct
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) datasets with varying amounts of reflection steps.
We observe that training models on rollouts with more reflection steps
primarily enhances first-answer correctness rather than the ability to correct
initially wrong answers through reflections. This motivates us to propose a
question-aware early-stopping method that enhances inference-time token
efficiency by stopping the reasoning process once a few plausible candidate
answers are generated, thereby reducing unnecessary reflection steps. Motivated
by this, we further propose to dynamically truncate the reflections after a
candidate answer has appeared during generation, which reduces reasoning tokens
by 24.5% across five mathematical datasets, within a 2.9% drop in accuracy.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出Cover@tau评估指标来替代Pass@k，用于更准确地衡量语言模型在推理任务中的真实能力边界，避免随机猜测带来的误导。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Pass@k指标在大采样预算下会因随机猜测而高估模型推理能力，无法真实反映模型在可靠性阈值下的推理边界。

Method: 提出Cover@tau指标，测量模型在至少tau比例补全正确的情况下能解决的问题比例，通过可靠性阈值排除随机猜测的影响。

Result: 使用Cover@tau评估多个RLVR模型，发现相比Pass@1，模型相对排名发生变化，提供了对推理边界的不同视角。

Conclusion: Cover@tau能更准确地评估语言模型的真实推理能力，特别是在离散答案空间任务中，为模型比较提供了更可靠的指标。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a
powerful paradigm to improve Large Language Models on reasoning tasks such as
coding, math or logic. To assess the reasoning boundary (the fraction of
problems a model can solve) researchers often report Pass@k at large sampling
budgets. Recent results reveal a crossover phenomenon: while RLVR models
outperform the base model at small k values, the base model usually outperforms
them when sampling a very large number of completions. This has been
interpreted as evidence that base models have a larger reasoning boundary. We
argue that on tasks with discrete answer spaces, such as math with numeric
outputs, Pass@k at large k reflects the increasingly higher chance of success
in the limit of the number of trials rather than genuine reasoning, and can
therefore be misleading. We propose Cover@tau, which measures the fraction of
problems that a model can solve for which at least a tau proportion of
completions are correct. Unlike Pass@k, Cover@tau captures reasoning under an
explicit reliability threshold: models that rely on random guessing degrade
rapidly as tau increases. We evaluate several RLVR models using Cover@tau-based
metrics and illustrate how the relative rankings of popular algorithms change
compared to Pass@1, offering a different perspective on reasoning boundaries.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统消费者研究成本高昂且存在面板偏见和规模限制，LLM提供替代方案但直接询问数值评分会产生不现实的响应分布。

Method: SSR方法：从LLM获取文本响应，通过嵌入相似度将这些响应映射到参考陈述的李克特分布。

Result: 在57个个人护理产品调查数据集上测试，SSR达到人类测试-重测信度的90%，同时保持现实的响应分布(KS相似度>0.85)，并提供丰富的定性反馈。

Conclusion: 该框架实现了可扩展的消费者研究模拟，同时保留了传统调查指标和可解释性。

Abstract: Consumer research costs companies billions annually yet suffers from panel
biases and limited scale. Large language models (LLMs) offer an alternative by
simulating synthetic consumers, but produce unrealistic response distributions
when asked directly for numerical ratings. We present semantic similarity
rating (SSR), a method that elicits textual responses from LLMs and maps these
to Likert distributions using embedding similarity to reference statements.
Testing on an extensive dataset comprising 57 personal care product surveys
conducted by a leading corporation in that market (9,300 human responses), SSR
achieves 90% of human test-retest reliability while maintaining realistic
response distributions (KS similarity > 0.85). Additionally, these synthetic
respondents provide rich qualitative feedback explaining their ratings. This
framework enables scalable consumer research simulations while preserving
traditional survey metrics and interpretability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RAG在复杂查询理解方面存在不足，基于强化学习的搜索代理虽然前景广阔，但仍面临泛化和部署挑战。

Method: 采用模块化搜索代理进行多步决策，通过强化学习训练以优化检索质量，支持准确的下游答案生成。

Result: 实验表明QAgent在问答任务上表现优异，可作为即插即用模块在实际应用中部署。

Conclusion: QAgent通过专注于有效检索的策略，增强了LLM应用的泛化能力，为现实世界部署提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at natural language tasks but are limited
by their static parametric knowledge, especially in knowledge-intensive task.
Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) mitigates this by integrating external
information. However, (1) traditional RAG struggles with complex query
understanding, and (2) even search agents trained with reinforcement learning
(RL), despite their promise, still face generalization and deployment
challenges. To address these limitations, we propose QAgent, a unified agentic
RAG framework that employs a search agent for adaptive retrieval. This agent
optimizes its understanding of the query through interactive reasoning and
retrieval. To facilitate real-world application, we focus on modular search
agent for query understanding that are plug-and-play in complex systems.
Secifically, the agent follows a multi-step decision process trained with RL to
maximize retrieval quality and support accurate downstream answers. We further
analyze the strengths and weaknesses of end-to-end RL and propose a strategy
that focuses on effective retrieval, thereby enhancing generalization in LLM
applications. Experiments show QAgent excels at QA and serves as a
plug-and-play module for real-world deployment.

Motivation: LLM幻觉检测是可信部署的基本挑战，现有不确定性驱动框架有限，需要更有效的方法来理解模型内部推理过程。

Method: 通过测量多个模型输出和不同层隐藏状态的有效秩来量化不确定性，基于表示谱分析提供可解释的语义变化洞察。

Result: 广泛实验表明该方法能有效检测幻觉，在各种场景下具有鲁棒泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法为LLM真实性检测提供了新范式，结合了理论优雅性和实践效率。

Abstract: Detecting hallucinations in large language models (LLMs) remains a
fundamental challenge for their trustworthy deployment. Going beyond basic
uncertainty-driven hallucination detection frameworks, we propose a simple yet
powerful method that quantifies uncertainty by measuring the effective rank of
hidden states derived from multiple model outputs and different layers.
Grounded in the spectral analysis of representations, our approach provides
interpretable insights into the model's internal reasoning process through
semantic variations, while requiring no extra knowledge or additional modules,
thus offering a combination of theoretical elegance and practical efficiency.
Meanwhile, we theoretically demonstrate the necessity of quantifying
uncertainty both internally (representations of a single response) and
externally (different responses), providing a justification for using
representations among different layers and responses from LLMs to detect
hallucinations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method effectively
detects hallucinations and generalizes robustly across various scenarios,
contributing to a new paradigm of hallucination detection for LLM truthfulness.

Conclusion: 动态门控是高效多模态学习的强大工具，即使在严格约束下也能提供可解释性和性能

Abstract: Training vision-language models on cognitively-plausible amounts of data
requires rethinking how models integrate multimodal information. Within the
constraints of the Vision track for the BabyLM Challenge 2025, we propose a
lightweight decoder-based architecture with (1) token-wise dynamic gating for
adaptive fusion of linguistic and visual cues, (2) feature modulation and
channel attention to maximise the utility of limited visual information and (3)
auxiliary contrastive objectives for visual grounding. Evaluation on five
benchmarks (BLiMP, BLiMP Supplement, EWoK, Winoground and VQA) shows
competitive or superior performance to multimodal baselines. More notably, our
dynamic gate discovers interpretable patterns without explicit supervision,
favouring visual cues for content words and linguistic cues for function words.
While we identify limitations in the Challenge constraints, such as the
information bottleneck created by global image embeddings and training
instability from the dataset split, our findings establish dynamic gating as a
powerful tool for efficient multimodal learning, offering both interpretability
and performance even under severe constraints.

<details>

Motivation: 现有LLM在AutoML和Kaggle竞赛等机器学习工程场景中缺乏细粒度领域先验知识，传统MLE方法使用线性或树状搜索限制了知识传递和搜索空间多样性。

Method: 结合领域知识库提供高质量先验指导，使用蒙特卡洛图搜索（MCGS）实现动态路径重组、历史轨迹重用和多解决方案融合，支持自进化和协作学习。

Conclusion: AutoMLGen通过集成领域知识库和MCGS搜索策略，显著提升了机器学习工程任务的性能，证明了该方法在复杂优化场景中的有效性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance in general
programming tasks. However, in Machine Learning Engineering (MLE) scenarios
such as AutoML and Kaggle competitions, achieving high performance depends
heavily on expert intervention and repeated adjustments rather than simply
generating correct code. When applied directly to these tasks, LLMs often lack
fine-grained domain priors, and existing MLE approaches that use linear or
tree-structured searches limit knowledge transfer to adjacent hierarchical
links. As a result, they cannot leverage past full trajectories or share
information across branches, limiting self-evolving ability and search space
diversity. To address these limitations, we introduce AutoMLGen, an LLM-based
coding agent that integrates a domain knowledge base for high-quality prior
guidance and Monte Carlo Graph Search (MCGS) for efficient exploration. MCGS
retains the tree-guided exploration of MCTS while embedding a graph structure
into the expansion stage to enable dynamic path reorganization, historical
trajectory reuse, and multi-solution fusion to support both self-evolution and
collaborative learning. Combined with fine-grained operator sets, this design
improves stability and accelerates convergence. Evaluation on the MLE-Bench
shows that AutoMLGen achieves state-of-the-art performance in numerous
dimensions, such as the average medal rate and the valid submission rate, under
a 12-hour budget (half the standard runtime). The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多任务需要模型在多轮交互中策略性地收集信息，但模型需要知道何时停止收集信息并做出决策，以避免过度思考或偏离方向

Method: 使用反事实轨迹对进行微调：一条轨迹在适当终止，另一条是相同轨迹的最小修改版本但不该终止。通过语言推理训练LLM解释终止决策的合理性

Result: 在医疗诊断和数学问题解决两个领域的实验表明，CaRT相比其他微调方法提高了信息收集效率和任务成功率

Conclusion: CaRT方法能有效教导LLMs何时停止信息收集，通过反事实推理训练提升了模型在策略性信息收集任务中的表现

Abstract: Many tasks require learned models to strategically gather relevant
information over multiple rounds of interaction before actually acting on a
task. Strategic information gathering requires models to know not only how to
effectively acquire information, but also when to stop gathering information
and make a decision, in order to avoid overthinking or getting derailed when
acting. In this paper, we formalize this problem and introduce Counterfactuals
and Reasoning for Termination (CaRT), an approach for teaching LLMs when to
stop seeking information. To appropriately learn when to terminate, CaRT
fine-tunes LLMs using counterfactual pairs of trajectories, one where
termination is appropriate and a minimally modified version of the same
trajectory where it is not. It trains the LLM to explain the rationale for the
termination decision in either case via verbal reasoning, and imbues this
capability into the base LLM via fine-tuning. We instantiate CaRT in two
domains: interactive medical diagnosis and math problem solving. In both
domains, we find that CaRT improves the efficiency of information gathering and
task success rate compared to other fine-tuning methods.

Abstract: A long-term goal of language agents is to learn and improve through their own
experience, ultimately outperforming humans in complex, real-world tasks.
However, training agents from experience data with reinforcement learning
remains difficult in many environments, which either lack verifiable rewards
(e.g., websites) or require inefficient long-horizon rollouts (e.g., multi-turn
tool use). As a result, most current agents rely on supervised fine-tuning on
expert data, which is challenging to scale and generalizes poorly. This
limitation stems from the nature of expert demonstrations: they capture only a
narrow range of scenarios and expose the agent to limited environment
diversity. We address this limitation with a middle-ground paradigm we call
early experience: interaction data generated by the agent's own actions, where
the resulting future states serve as supervision without reward signals. Within
this paradigm we study two strategies of using such data: (1) Implicit world
modeling, which uses collected states to ground the policy in environment
dynamics; and (2) Self-reflection, where the agent learns from its suboptimal
actions to improve reasoning and decision-making. We evaluate across eight
diverse environments and multiple model families. Our approaches consistently
improve effectiveness and out-of-domain generalization, highlighting the value
of early experience. Moreover, in environments with verifiable rewards, our
results provide promising signals that early experience offers a strong
foundation for subsequent reinforcement learning, positioning it as a practical
bridge between imitation learning and fully experience-driven agents.

Abstract: How can we teach large multimodal models (LMMs) new skills without erasing
prior abilities? We study sequential fine-tuning on five target skills while
monitoring general ability on eight held-out benchmarks across three model
families. We observe that apparent "forgetting" on held-out tasks after narrow
fine-tuning can partly recover at later stages. We trace this behavior to a
measurable shift in the output token distribution, manifested through a simple
counting-bias probe that co-varies with forgetting. Guided by this picture, we
identify two simple, robust tuning recipes that learn strongly while limiting
drift: (i) updating only the self-attention projection layers, and (ii)
updating only the MLP Gate&Up while freezing the Down projection. Across models
and tasks, these choices deliver strong target gains while largely preserving
held-out performance. Code is available at
