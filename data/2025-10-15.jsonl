In this work, we\nreframe working memory management as a learnable, intrinsic capability. We\npropose a novel framework, Memory-as-Action, where an agent actively manages\nits working memory by executing explicit editing operations as part of a\nunified policy. This formulation allows an agent, trained via reinforcement\nlearning, to balance memory curation against long-term task objectives under\ngiven resource constraints. However, such memory editing actions break the\nstandard assumption of a continuously growing prefix in LLM interactions,\nleading to what we call trajectory fractures. These non-prefix changes disrupt\nthe causal continuity required by standard policy gradient methods, making\nthose methods inapplicable. To address this, we propose a new algorithm,\nDynamic Context Policy Optimization, which enables stable end-to-end\nreinforcement learning by segmenting trajectories at memory action points and\napplying trajectory-level advantages to the resulting action segments.

To bridge this gap, we present\n\\textit{Embodied Reasoning Agent (ERA)}, a two-stage framework that integrates\nprior knowledge learning and online reinforcement learning (RL). The first\nstage, \\textit{Embodied Prior Learning}, distills foundational knowledge from\nthree types of data: (1) Trajectory-Augmented Priors, which enrich existing\ntrajectory data with structured reasoning generated by stronger models; (2)\nEnvironment-Anchored Priors, which provide in-environment knowledge and\ngrounding supervision; and (3) External Knowledge Priors, which transfer\ngeneral knowledge from out-of-environment datasets.

To overcome the inherent challenges in agent RL, including\nlong horizons, sparse rewards, and training instability, we introduce three key\ndesigns: self-summarization for context management, dense reward shaping, and\nturn-level policy optimization.

In this\ncontext, vehicle-to-vehicle communication plays a crucial role, as it enables\ncars to share information and remain aware of each other even when sensors are\noccluded.
