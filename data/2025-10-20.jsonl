Yet\nmost LM evaluations focus on problems with well-defined answers and success\ncriteria. This gap exists in part because natural problems involving\nuncertainty are difficult to construct: given that LMs have access to most of\nthe same knowledge as humans, it is non-trivial to design questions for which\nLMs will struggle to produce correct answers, but which humans can answer\nreliably. As a result, LM performance on reasoning under uncertainty remains\npoorly characterized. To address this gap, we introduce OpenEstimate, an\nextensible, multi-domain benchmark for evaluating LMs on numerical estimation\ntasks that require models to synthesize significant amounts of background\ninformation and express predictions as probabilistic priors. We assess these\npriors for accuracy and calibration, quantifying their usefulness relative to\nsamples from the true distribution of interest. Across six frontier LMs, we\nfind that LM-elicited priors are often inaccurate and overconfident.\nPerformance improves modestly depending on how uncertainty is elicited from the\nmodel, but is largely unaffected by changes in sampling strategy, reasoning\neffort, or prompt design. The OpenEstimate benchmark thus offers a challenging\nevaluation for frontier LMs and a platform for developing models that are\nbetter at probabilistic estimation and reasoning under uncertainty."}

In this\nstudy, a novel method for procedural level design using Deep Reinforcement\nLearning (DRL) within a Unity-based 3D environment is proposed. The system\ncomprises two agents: a hummingbird agent, acting as a solver, and a floating\nisland agent, responsible for generating and placing collectible objects\n(flowers) on the terrain in a realistic and context-aware manner. The\nhummingbird is trained using the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm\nfrom the Unity ML-Agents toolkit. It learns to navigate through the terrain\nefficiently, locate flowers, and collect them while adapting to the\never-changing procedural layout of the island. The island agent is also trained\nusing the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm. It learns to generate\nflower layouts based on observed obstacle positions, the hummingbird's initial\nstate, and performance feedback from previous episodes. The interaction between\nthese agents leads to emergent behavior and robust generalization across\nvarious environmental configurations.

While large language\nmodels (LLMs) have greatly advanced SQL generation though prompting, supervised\nfinetuning and reinforced tuning, the shift toward test-time scaling exposes a\nnew bottleneck: selecting the correct query from a diverse candidate pool.\nExisting selection approaches, such as self-consistency or best-of-$N$\ndecoding, provide only shallow signals, making them prone to inconsistent\nscoring, fragile reasoning chains, and a failure to capture fine-grained\nsemantic distinctions between closely related SQL candidates. To this end, we\nintroduce JudgeSQL, a principled framework that redefines SQL candidate\nselection through structured reasoning and weighted consensus tournament\nmechanism. JudgeSQL develops a reasoning-based SQL judge model that distills\nreasoning traces with reinforcement learning guided by verifiable rewards,\nenabling accurate and interpretable judgments. Building on this, a weighted\nconsensus tournament integrates explicit reasoning preferences with implicit\ngenerator confidence, yielding selections that are both more reliable and more\nefficient. Extensive experiments on the BIRD benchmark demonstrate that\nJudgeSQL exhibits superior SQL judgment capabilities and good cross-scale\ngeneralization and robustness to generator capacity."}

We developed a machine learning framework to integrate\ndiverse context from prior visits to improve health monitoring, especially when\nprior visits are limited and their frequency is variable. Our model first\nestimates initial risk of disease using medical data from the most recent\npatient visit, then refines this assessment using information digested from\npreviously collected imaging and/or clinical biomarkers. We applied our\nframework to prostate cancer (PCa) risk prediction using data from a large\npopulation (28,342 patients, 39,013 magnetic resonance imaging scans, 68,931\nblood tests) collected over nearly a decade. For predictions of the risk of\nclinically significant PCa at the time of the visit, integrating prior context\ndirectly converted false positives to true negatives, increasing overall\nspecificity while preserving high sensitivity. False positive rates were\nreduced progressively from 51% to 33% when integrating information from up to\nthree prior imaging examinations, as compared to using data from a single\nvisit, and were further reduced to 24% when also including additional context\nfrom prior clinical data. For predicting the risk of PCa within five years of\nthe visit, incorporating prior context reduced false positive rates still\nfurther (64% to 9%). Our findings show that information collected over time\nprovides relevant context to enhance the specificity of medical risk\nprediction. For a wide range of progressive conditions, sufficient reduction of\nfalse positive rates using context could offer a pathway to expand longitudinal\nhealth monitoring programs to large populations with comparatively low baseline\nrisk of disease, leading to earlier detection and improved health outcomes."}

To\naddress this limitation, we first introduce SciRecipe, a large-scale dataset of\nover 12K structured protocols spanning 27 biological subfields and encompassing\nboth comprehension and problem-solving tasks. To further improve protocol\ngeneration, we propose the \"Sketch-and-Fill\" paradigm, which separates\nanalysis, structuring, and expression to ensure each step is explicit and\nverifiable. Complementing this, the structured component-based reward mechanism\nevaluates step granularity, action order, and semantic fidelity, aligning model\noptimization with experimental reliability. Building on these components, we\ndevelop Thoth, trained through a staged Knowledge-to-Action process that\nprogresses from knowledge acquisition to operational reasoning and ultimately\nto robust, executable protocol generation.

Recent alternatives such as Direct Preference\nOptimization (DPO) simplify this pipeline by directly optimizing on\npreferences. However, both approaches often assume uniform annotator\npreferences and rely on binary comparisons, overlooking two key limitations:\nthe diversity of human evaluators and the limitations of pairwise feedback. In\nthis work, we address both these issues. First, we connect preference learning\nin RLHF with the econometrics literature and show that binary comparisons are\ninsufficient for identifying latent user preferences from finite user data and\ninfinite users, while (even incomplete) rankings over three or more responses\nensure identifiability. Second, we introduce methods to incorporate\nheterogeneous preferences into alignment algorithms. We develop an\nExpectation-Maximization adaptation of DPO that discovers latent annotator\ntypes and trains a mixture of LLMs accordingly.

The use of\nstate-of-the-art artificial intelligence systems (notably Large Language\nModel-based agents) collaborating with humans on solving such problems is being\nactively explored. While the abilities of LLMs can be improved by, for example,\nfine-tuning, hand-crafted system prompts and scaffolding with external tools,\nLLMs lack endogenous mechanisms to develop expertise through experience in such\nsettings. This work address this gap with Dialectica, a framework where agents\nengage in structured dialogue on defined topics, augmented by memory,\nself-reflection, and policy-constrained context editing. Formally, discussion\nis viewed as an implicit meta-reinforcement learning process. The\n`dialogue-trained' agents are evaluated post-hoc using judged pairwise\ncomparisons of elicited responses.
