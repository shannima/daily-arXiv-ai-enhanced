The effect of verification manifests\nthrough interactions of three quantities: (i) the generator's coverage, (ii)\nthe verifier's region of convergence (ROC), and (iii) the sampling algorithm's\nsub-optimality. Though recent studies capture subsets of these factors, a\nunified framework quantifying the geometry of their interplay is missing. We\nframe verifiable test-time scaling as a transport problem. This characterizes\nthe interaction of coverage, ROC, and sub-optimality, and uncovers that the\nsub-optimality--coverage curve exhibits three regimes. A transport regime --\nwhere sub-optimality increases with coverage, a policy improvement regime --\nwhere sub-optimality may decrease with coverage, depending on the verifier's\nROC, and a saturation regime -- where sub-optimality plateaus, unaffected by\ncoverage.

To\ngather clear, reproducible examples, we ran the Misalignment Bounty: a\ncrowdsourced project that collected cases of agents pursuing unintended or\nunsafe goals. The bounty received 295 submissions, of which nine were awarded.\n  This report explains the program's motivation and evaluation criteria, and\nwalks through the nine winning submissions step by step."}

However, evaluating proactivity is challenging; current\nbenchmarks are constrained to localized context, limiting their ability to test\nreasoning across sources and longer time horizons. To address this gap, we\npresent PROBE (Proactive Resolution Of BottlEnecks). PROBE decomposes\nproactivity as a pipeline of three core capabilities: (1) searching for\nunspecified issues, (2) identifying specific bottlenecks, and (3) executing\nappropriate resolutions. We apply PROBE to evaluate leading LLMs and popular\nagentic frameworks, showing that even state-of-the-art models struggle to solve\nthis benchmark. Computing our consistent measurements across frontier LLMs and\nagents, we find that the best end-to-end performance of 40% is achieved by both\nGPT-5 and Claude Opus-4.1. Additionally, we demonstrate the relative\ncapabilities of each model and analyze mutual failure modes. Our results\nhighlight the current limitations of autonomous action in agentic systems, and\nexpose promising future research directions."}

Current methods for learning and\nevaluating world models diverge from this goal: training and evaluation are\nanchored to next-frame prediction, and success is scored by reward maximization\nin the same environment. We propose WorldTest, a protocol to evaluate\nmodel-learning agents that separates reward-free interaction from a scored test\nphase in a different but related environment. WorldTest is\nopen-ended$\\unicode{x2014}$models should support many different tasks unknown\nahead of time$\\unicode{x2014}$and agnostic to model representation, allowing\ncomparison across approaches. We instantiated WorldTest with AutumnBench, a\nsuite of 43 interactive grid-world environments and 129 tasks across three\nfamilies: masked-frame prediction, planning, and predicting changes to the\ncausal dynamics. We compared 517 human participants and three frontier models\non AutumnBench. We found that humans outperform the models, and scaling compute\nimproves performance only in some environments but not others. WorldTest\nprovides a novel template$\\unicode{x2014}$reward-free exploration, derived\ntests, and behavior-based scoring$\\unicode{x2014}$to evaluate what agents learn\nabout environment dynamics, and AutumnBench exposes significant headroom in\nworld-model learning."}
